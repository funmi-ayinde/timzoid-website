								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying fit and healthy has become a chief concern for our society. Many people strive to be in the best physical shape possible by taking on sports and exercise, keep their minds tidy by meditating, and maintain a diet of their choice. Meanwhile, healthcare systems around the world face the need to evolve, adopt new technologies, and tackle long-standing challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet of Things (IoT) is the enabling technology of many health and wellness related activities and processes. It is invisible, cost-effective, solves ongoing challenges and opens doors for new creative opportunities, and has a short learning curve. Most importantly, it allows everyone to stay healthy and helps medical experts save lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As promising as it already sounds, the promise of IoT in healthcare is broader still — the technology will help the industry perform a meaningful evolution. From ultimate personalization with DNA testing, to sophisticated sleep technology, to smarter houses for Parkinson’s disease patients, let’s explore how connected devices will change the healthcare industry.</span></p>
<h2>Connected Wellness Devices</h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evolution of Device Ecosystems</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying fit and healthy is the main driver of modern lifestyles. Here, smart IoT devices for wellness have become our helpers. Connected gadgets provide and gather important information, motivate us, and even serve as our trainers, among other things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the vast majority of people who exercise and closely monitor their health have at least a smart watch or bracelet alongside their smartphones and fitness apps, which all work together in one ecosystem. Although they have long become essential to modern exercise routines, as technologies continue to evolve, the role these devices play will only keep growing. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16648" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-1024x683.jpg" alt="Connected health devices" width="655" height="437" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Connected-Health-and-Wellness-Devices-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundation for these developments is already in place. The Apple and Fitbit IoT ecosystems are already so vast that can use advanced algorithms to provide their users with spot-on insights and workout recommendations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the latest Apple Watch model has an ECG feature, we can also expect future IoT devices would perform checks that are currently possible only in medical facilities, gathering even more information and providing even better recommendations.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wellness Devices will Reach Ultimate Personalization</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing IoT wellness devices gather many types of data and provide deeply personalized recommendations to users, Still, the highest level of personalization will be enabled by more sophisticated means that rely heavily on IoT technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><a href="https://www.skulpt.me/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skulpt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed a scanning device that allows users to analyse fat-to-muscle ratio and muscle health individually. The information is sent to the Skulpt app, as it performs an in-depth analysis and then offers users individual recommendations for safe and efficient workouts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, reaching the highest level of personalization can only be enabled by solutions based on </span><b>DNA testing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With properly developed AI-driven algorithms, these connected health and wellness devices will provide truly individual workout and diet recommendations.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fitnessgenes.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FitnessGenes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the existing examples. The company offers a three-step DNA analysis of vascular function, sleep cycles, saturated fat sensibilities, energy production, and other. After, the FitnessGenes app offers the user a genetically tailored nutrition plan and workout advice. As users continue to demand increasingly personalised products and services, health and wellness devices driven by DNA testing will be widely popular in the coming years.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Life of Group Fitness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small but highly effective, IoT sensors will gain more traction in fitness as well, especially group-focused exercises. Placed on each participant, the battery-powered wireless sensors will gather information and stream it to a TV screen or a trainer’s mobile device, in real-time. This way, the participants could follow the progress of others, while trainers can better cater to each client on-the-go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of data sharing, people love sharing their sports achievements with others, as well as connect with fellow fitness enthusiasts. So, apps like Strava will remain popular in the coming years, while also giving way to more curious solutions. For example, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">xMed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows users to diagnose health issues in two ways. First, it has AI-driven algorithms. Second, it serves us a social media network where users can ask fellow health and wellness enthusiasts for advice — or connect with medical experts. Smart watches and bracelets are in the equation, of course (learn more <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/cases/xmed-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16649" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Group-fitness-class-1024x683.jpg" alt="Wellness devices" width="649" height="433" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Group-fitness-class-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Group-fitness-class-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Group-fitness-class-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Group-fitness-class-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Group-fitness-class-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Group-fitness-class-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Sleep</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep deprivation has emerged as a widespread modern malaise. Scientists, public figures, and popular media outlets ring red alert on our bedtime habits and the low numbers of our shut-eye hours. Arianna Huffington went as far as to branding sleep deprivation “the new smoking” in a </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3060801/heres-arianna-huffingtons-recipe-for-a-great-night-of-sleep" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast Company article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as the condition causes a wide range of mental and physical health issues. Sound-based products providing ambient sounds do not seem to suffice anymore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except a sleep robot, wellness medical devices powered by IoT technology have emerged as the solution. Products on this market </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90283063/the-most-promising-health-and-wellness-trends-for-2019" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">include</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sleep trackers, nighttime wearables, and smart pillows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wellness connected devices include smart mattresses. </span><a href="https://eightsleep.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight Sleep</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a New York-based technology company, offers a comfortable mattress with IoT sensors, which gather data about fifteen sleep and health factors, and delivers it to the Eight Sleep app. The application also enables users to control the temperature of both sides of the bed. The latest version has an additional device called the Pod that can dynamically change the mattress temperature according to the gathered data about personal sleep temperature preferences for both sides of the bed. The solution can also be controlled with smart home systems like Alexa.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Connected Devices in Healthcare</strong></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote Wellness Monitoring Devices</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, hospitals and other medical institutions continue to struggle with high patient loads, as nurses face long extra hours. The problem will not go away anytime soon, at the very least. On top of that, finding funding remains an unsolved issue for many medical institutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, IoT comes forward as the most fitting solution, and one of the major drivers of the industry’s technological evolution. Connected health devices help solve healthcare’s critical issues in an effective, patient-friendly, and cost-effective way, as well as introduce many other benefits and solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the NHS (National Health Service) of the UK is currently at the second phase of testing </span><a href="https://www.sabp.nhs.uk/tihm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology Integrated Health Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (TIHM). The program reduces the number of hospital and home care admissions for dementia patients with a system of wellness monitoring devices, allowing them to comfortably stay at home for longer periods of time. The NHS installs the sensors in a patient’s place of stay, allowing clinicians to monitor their health remotely 24/7. The solution also involves artificial intelligence-driven algorithms, and can alert medical experts in a number of occasions.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16653" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Greenhouse-1024x640.jpg" alt="health and wellness devices" width="649" height="406" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Greenhouse-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Greenhouse-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Greenhouse-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Greenhouse-600x375.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Greenhouse-450x281.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Greenhouse-1000x625.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://builtin.com/internet-things/iot-in-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pfizer and IBM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went further with the concept to simplify the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The medical condition requires continuous assessment and medication regimen adjustments based on a patient’s movements, cognitive responses, and a myriad of other factors. During their study, the companies placed IoT sensors on the majority of objects to monitor the symptoms and relay the data to clinicians, which in turn can make the needed adjustments to the medication routine, as well as stay informed about the patient’s condition around the clock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution also leverages mobile devices and advanced machine learning capabilities. Pfizer and IBM strive to help people with Parkinson’s disease lead their lifestyles without being confined to a hospital while also gather data and streamline the patient management process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As taking care of patients with serious long-standing diseases is problematic in the face of overcrowded and busy hospitals, solutions with connected health devices can save medical institutions costs and significantly reduce (or even eliminate) the nurses’ extra hours. Due to their invisible and user-friendly nature, connected health devices have a very short learning curve. More so, they allow hospitals to provide patients with the best type of comfort — the comfort of their homes.  </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16661" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pills-1024x683.jpg" alt="wellness connected devices" width="651" height="434" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pills-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pills-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pills-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pills-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pills-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pills-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Medication Management</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring vaccines are kept at the right temperature at all times is critical. All the more so if they are dispatched to hard-to-reach regions with deadly diseases and a high demand for the cure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address this issue, </span><a href="https://builtin.com/internet-things/iot-in-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexleaf Analytics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created ColdTrace — a remote temperature monitoring system for vaccine refrigerators in rural healthcare organizations. An IoT sensor is installed into a refrigerator unit to monitor temperature and grid power, and the connected health devices system sends updates and alerts to the monitoring personnel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for more mundane situations, </span><a href="https://www.adheretech.com/how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdhereTech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created a Smart Pill Bottle to ensure a person does not fall out of their medication routine. Currently available only in the U.S., each bottle connects to the company’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HIPAA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compliant system to choose the most fitting treatment for every user. The solution also connects to the pharmacy system, notifying pharmacists about people who need their support in real-time. As a result, one uses the Smart Pill Bottle like a normal bottle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is important, the “invisibility” factor IoT healthcare solutions will continue playing a pivotal part in connected devices in healthcare. The less the patient has to learn about and deal with device, the easier and less stressful the treatment.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16654" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nurse-moving-baby-1024x683.jpg" alt="Connected devices in health care" width="654" height="436" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nurse-moving-baby-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nurse-moving-baby-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nurse-moving-baby-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nurse-moving-baby-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nurse-moving-baby-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nurse-moving-baby-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment Management</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospitals are big and busy, and even a bulky and expensive piece of medical equipment might get lost in a corridor, room, or one of the numerous wards. In the following years, more and more hospitals and medical organizations will turn to IoT technology to quickly locate the needed equipment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going back to the NHS, the organization’s Scottish wing started a pilot project with </span><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iot-and-the-nhs-why-the-internet-of-things-will-create-a-healthcare-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT-driven hospital beds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Caithness General Hospital. The beds are equipped with sensors that gather data for maintenance records and pinpoint beds’ whereabouts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In turn, </span><a href="https://builtin.com/internet-things/iot-in-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G.E.’s AutoBed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">platform can track nurse proximity. Installed at New York’s Mt. Sinai Hospital for testing, AutoBed also helps track the beds quickly. The numbers clearly indicate such solutions will gain traction in the future. G.E.’s platform had reduced emergency room (ER) wait times by several hours for fifty percent of the hospital’s ER patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, some hospitals are just too vast and demand more complex solutions. For example, one company needed an </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/cases/android-app-of-identification-solutions-provider" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equipment-monitoring IoT ecosystem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involving a wide range of connected devices: an RFID wand, RFID scanner, mobile app, and RFID tag printer. Together with a web portal, the devices help find and manage an extensive fleet of medical devices in large hospitals. </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If previous years were mostly marked by the exciting evolution of emerging technologies, 2020 will be different. Technology advances will often be accompanied by various public and private issues that companies and the public will need to consider and deal with. Still, this doesn’t mean 2020 won’t hold anything exciting, or that the big-scale adoption of new technologies will stop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will make projections across 5 technology areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI algorithms in fake news and the future of media</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The not-so-comfortable truth about the state of AR &amp; VR adoption </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endpoint growth, edge computing, and other IoT industry trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial organizations embracing a shared ecosystem</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First steps of face recognition technology in financial services</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many interesting developments to talk about. Let’s start.</span></p>
<h2><strong>AI Trends: Algorithms in Media &amp; Fake News</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media industry has already seen AI-driven virtual TV presenters </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJcdVjkqiW8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The technology paves the way for a potential revolution in the industry, allowing media companies to produce a lot of content on-the-fly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, over the last two years, the public, the media, governmental organizations, and prominent artists have grown increasingly alarmed about how deepfakes can sway opinions online, influencing political events. In 2017, the University of Washington created the notorious </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/01/business/pentagons-race-against-deepfakes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deepfake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmUC4m6w1wo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Barack Obama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there was a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a deepfake video of Mark Zuckerberg, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE1KWpoX9Hk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other examples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The resemblance between the real and fake political figures proved almost uncanny, prompting discussions about the big perils of deepfake technology and other AI uses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, doctored videos can be spotted upon closer examination, but the technology keeps evolving, while easy-to-use deepfake creation tools are available online. Although </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251736/deepfake-propaganda-misinformation-troll-video-hoax" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">current countermeasures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can detect deepfakes and their creators quickly and easily, this may change soon: the technology is evolving, so the countermeasures will need to evolve as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fighting fake articles online will be more challenging, though. MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) has been going to great lengths to showcase the scale of the problem. CSAIL has conducted two scientific investigations (publishing a paper for each in the August of 2019), and both showed that current AI-driven fake news detecting systems, no matter how sophisticated, are not effective enough and face many nuanced challenges.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/15/mit-csail-fights-fake-news-with-ai/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With other companies joining the battle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, (including Facebook), this means that we will definitely see more sophisticated AI tools aimed at reducing the quantity and impact of fake news in 2020 and beyond, across the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The laws will follow suit as well. In 2020, we may expect new deepfake and fake news scandals, hearings on that cases, as well as first instances of comprehensive regulation in the most progressive countries. All popular platforms would use AI algorithms to automatically detect and block deepfakes and fake news, as well as trace their creators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, trends in AI will be a hot topic in 2020.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Augmented &amp; Virtual Reality Trends Slow Down</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although established companies use AR in </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-brands-use-augmented-reality-in-manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacturing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/microsoft-hololens-usage-in-construction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-ar-apps-changed-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other industries, the general adoption progresses slowly. Games and gamified customer experiences continue to be the main driver for both AR and VR. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/future-ar-vr-survey/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a survey by XRDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fifty-nine percent of AR and VR projects are game-related. This won’t change anytime soon, at least for VR. Steam will be pushing its </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976234/valve-half-life-alyx-steamvr-index-headset-gaming-storefront-platform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SteamVR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platform with the recently announced Half-Life: Alyx, driving the competition on the VR market. Still, the adoption of both technologies continues to grow steadily in other industries, like education and training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As AR has been growing slowly in the last two years, there is no indication this will change in 2020, despite the release of HoloLens 2 in November 2019. There is the usual back-and-forth in the rumours about Apple’s AR headset, but hard evidence on whatever the company is developing will are non-existent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, we can expect AR to continue breathing new life into familiar experiences. Readers tired of consuming content the old way will definitely enjoy immersive experiences and new story angles enabled by the technology, like those seen in The New York Times </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/augmented-reality" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR/VR section</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and by </span><a href="https://time.com/5628880/time-immersive-app-ar-vr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIME’s new AR/VR app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for other augmented reality trends, the technology will also help ecommerce drive sales in 2020 and beyond. As customers are tired of the same types of ads and their ubiquity, brands will follow into the steps of Instagram (who released its </span><a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spark AR Studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to public this year), building AR catalogues of their goods and creating digital experiences with AR lenses in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR lenses and filters are booming, but they should be approached carefully by development teams in the future. For example, Instagram removed filters that depict or promote cosmetic surgery amid concerns they </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50152053"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harm mental health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR try-in on web pages and in mobile apps would also gain more traction. This option is more cost-effective compared to other AR solutions as well as convenient for users, who would only need to open the camera on their smartphone to try a T-shirt or sunglasses on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002243591930020X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by four UK universities, AR improves decision comfort, prompts users to give positive word-of-mouth recommendations, and drives sales of more expensive products.  </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17616" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1024x683.jpg" alt="augmented reality trends" width="780" height="520" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big-scale adoption of AR will continue in 2020 with products like Adobe’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/adobe-launches-aero-its-ar-authoring-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allows designers to create AR experience without coding easily. The iPad app gives users a step-by-step guide on how to build AR scenes, allowing them to use their existing assets from the Adobe Creative Cloud. The app allows to create basic AR experiences, with the full-fledged version coming to desktop in 2020. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Internet of Things — Adoption Continues  </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the IoT industry trends are connected to streamlining existing IoT-driven operations further, sustating IoT device growth, and building massive ecosystems.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Tapping into IoT Metadata</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last decade, enterprises have been gathering and using data from smart endpoint devices in their IoT ecosystems to a great extent. The next step will be </span><a href="https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/internet-of-things/5-emerging-iot-trends-to-watch-in-2020/3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using that data’s metadata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to drive intelligence systems, increasing the level of personalization further, and giving context to otherwise incomprehensive scenarios in data sets. As a result, the companies will be able to structure unstructured data and improve the process of developing their cognitive systems.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Confident Endpoint Growth</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying on the subject of endpoints, their number will grow in 2020, as devices like smart meters, smart lighting, and smart air conditioning are becoming increasingly common in commercial and residential markets. </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-08-29-gartner-says-5-8-billion-enterprise-and-automotive-io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Gartner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the utilities industry, who is the leader in endpoint usage, was operating 1.17 billion endpoints in 2019, and the firm projects the number will grow by 14.6 percent in 2020, reaching 1.37 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the governmental sector will see a more dramatic spike: from 0.53 billion to 0.70 billion (24.3 percent). The quantity of endpoints will also grow substantially in the building automation and physical security industries. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Other Internet of Things Trends: Edge Computing, Digital Twins</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What else can be expected in the IoT area in 2020? </span><a href="https://www.techcentral.ie/iot-in-2020-awkward-times-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to IDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enterprises will begin transitioning from cloud-based IoT deployments to edge computing to further streamline IoT deployments and application performance in their ecosystems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for big trends in IoT, the Port of Rotterdam, the largest in Europe, has started a massive project of digitizing its every operation, which will continue in 2020. Some parts of the harbor are already automated, but the ports leadership and partners plan to use the digital twin technology and IoT for a complete digital transformation. The end goal is to entirely rid the port of time loss, cargo loss, spills of CO2, and safety incidents. The harbor also wants to berth crewless automated ships somewhere around 2030. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about the port’s plans and progress in detail in the video:</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Port of Rotterdam: Europe&#039;s Strongest Digital Twin Case Study | IoT World Europe 2018 webinar" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_ihbnUuAAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Open &amp; Decentralized Finance</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all likelihood, 2020 will be a watermark year for banks and financial institutions, as they face the inevitability of a large-scale transformation. The concept of open finance — an ecosystem of shared services that converges users and companies in one place to enable better efficiency and experiences — will be the overarching trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that financial organizations will have shared transaction data, IT infrastructure, and cross-compatible systems, while the ecosystem itself will be enabled by distributed technologies and more sophisticated and accessible APIs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed technology will play a key role in the evolution of the entire industry, giving way to decentralized financial services: lending, borrowing, and other financial operations will be provided on decentralized distributed platforms. Banks will use distributed ledgers to issue bonds (</span><a href="https://media.consensys.net/5-sibos-takeaways-the-future-of-finance-according-to-banks-and-institutions-a45fd53298fe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Societe Generale and Santander did</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), as digital markets with tokenized financial instruments will emerge. Payments, meanwhile, will be transferred to permission-based distributed networks to enable high security and speed.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Face Recognition in Financial Services</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As facial recognition is available in more and more smartphones and can help financial organizations cut costs and simplify operations and customer experiences, we can expect more financial services that use face recognition at different customer touchpoints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users will be able to verify different actions related to their accounts in seconds by letting smartphones scan their faces. Still, this will require a high level of security from both the financial institutions, smartphone designers, and software teams behind mobile operating systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of a federated identity — using your face to manage all of your financial operations — is also on the table, but it will take time to evolve. Mexico has </span><a href="https://observer.com/2019/11/trueface-artificial-intelligence-facial-recognition-future-banking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a biometric security mandate to bring this idea to life, so we can probably expect other countries to follow suit in 2020.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Summing Up Technology Trends for 2020</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although major breakthroughs are not in the cards, 2020 will be yet another eventful year for the tech industry and the world. AI will play the most important role at the both sides of the fake news war in 2020, prompting governments to come up with never-before-seen laws. AR adoption has slowed down significantly, and this may continue until Apple releases its first AR device. IoT adoption continues, as companies across industries tap into new types of data, use more endpoints, and find ways to streamline deployments; massive IoT projects like digitization of the Port of Rotterdam are also underway. With no time left to postpone transformation, financial organizations embrace modern times with big plans for setting up shared systems to deliver next-gen user experiences. Finally, face recognition is slowly coming to financial operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s still going to be exciting. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/intellectsoft" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stay tuned</a>.</span></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get to business.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet of Things for Healthcare</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market of IoT in healthcare is predicted to exceed $10 billion by 2024, according to a </span><a href="https://brandessenceresearch.biz/ICT-and-Media/Internet-of-Things-(IoT)-in-Utility-Market/Summary" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brandessence market research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This growth forecast is also impacted by other important technologies. IoT is slowly getting traction and evolving alongside the new ultra-fast 5G mobile wireless, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Big Data. Combing this powerful technologies with the Internet of Things will likely revolutionize the healthcare industry. IoT in healthcare using 5G wireless and AI could, for example, completely transform the way patients are monitored and treated remotely.</span></p>
<p><b>Still, IoT will not only help with the patient’s health, but also improve the productivity of the healthcare industry workers. </b></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What exactly is IoT and why it is important in healthcare? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, IoT is the concept created around the idea of full ubiquitous computing, which is the processing of information linked with external activity or objects. Ubiquitous computing involves connecting electronic devices with microprocessors and sensors to talk to each other.</span><b> IoT is a ubiquitous network except that all of those electronic devices have access to the Internet.  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT in the healthcare industry is a great example of this omnipresent computing. For example, hundreds of intelligent electronic devices can be set up in a hospital to monitor patients’ health status 24/7, talk to each other, make decisions, and upload information to a healthcare cloud platform.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT in Healthcare Examples</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How IoT can be used in healthcare effectively? Let’s explore three workable Internet of Things healthcare examples below. </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensing and uploading up-to-date patient information to the cloud in emergency situations, from the ambulance or even from home. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical devices capable of performing self-maintenance. IoT healthcare devices will sense their own components, detect low thresholds, and communicate with medical personnel and manufacturers.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT and wearables can help home patients and elderly communicate directly with a healthcare facility.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telemedicine can be considered a “primitive” form of an Internet of Things in healthcare example. With IoT, a patient can be observed and in some cases treated remotely through video cameras and other electronic actuators. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16915" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Remote-Assistance-1024x682.jpg" alt="iot in healthcare examples" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Remote-Assistance-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Remote-Assistance-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Remote-Assistance-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Remote-Assistance-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Remote-Assistance-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Remote-Assistance-1000x666.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Remote-Assistance.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How IoT Works in Healthcare?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand how the Internet of Things in Healthcare works, let’s see how IoT works in general. As discussed above, an IoT unit can be considered as a device with a sensor that can interact with the physical world and send information to the Internet. </span></p>
<p><b>In healthcare, these devices can gather different patient data and receive inputs from health practitioners.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> An Internet of Things Healthcare example is continuous glucose monitoring for insulin pens that works effectively for patients with diabetes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these devices are able to communicate with each other and in some cases take important actions that would provide timely help or even save a life. For example, an IoT healthcare device can make intelligent decisions like calling the healthcare facility if an elderly person has fallen down. After collecting passive data, an IoT healthcare device would send this critical information to the cloud so that doctors can act upon it — view the general patient status, see if calling an ambulance is necessary, what type of help is required, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, Internet of Things Healthcare can greatly improve not only a patient’s health and help in critical situations, but also the productivity of health employees and hospital workflows. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How IoT helps in healthcare — Process </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s explore an IoT healthcare workflow example:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sensor collects data from a patient or a doctor/nurse inputs data. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An IoT device analyzes the collected data with the help of AI-driven algorithms like machine learning (ML). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The device makes a decision whether to act or send the information to the cloud. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors, health practitioners, or even robots are enabled to make actionable and informed decisions based on the data provided by the IoT device. </span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT Devices in Healthcare</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although not all IoT devices should have a sensor, they at least need to have a radio and a given TCP/IP address to enable communication with the Internet. As long as a device has access to the Internet, it can be considered an IoT device. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16916" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Watch-with-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-Feature-1024x576.jpg" alt="iot devices in healthcare" width="649" height="365" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Watch-with-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-Feature-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Watch-with-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-Feature-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Watch-with-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-Feature-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Watch-with-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-Feature-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Watch-with-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-Feature-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Watch-with-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-Feature-1000x563.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Watch-with-Heart-Rate-Monitoring-Feature.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, every smartphone is an IoT device. A smartphone with the right set of healthcare apps can help you detect diseases and improve your health. Some examples of these are skin cancer detection apps that use your camera and AI-driven algorithms to map moles on your skin. Other examples would be sleep, yoga, fitness, and pill management apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, smartphone is a smartphone. Monitoring healthcare is not its primary application. A dedicated healthcare IoT device can do significantly more.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Smartwatch. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearables sold at consumer electronics stores come with a sensor and Internet connection. Some of them (like iWatch Series 4) can even monitor your heart rate, control diabetes, help in speech treatment, aid in improving posture, and detect seizures. </span></li>
<li><b>Insulin Pens and Smart CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring). <span style="font-weight: 400;">These devices can monitor blood glucose levels and send the data to a dedicated smartphone app. Patients with diabetes can use these devices to track their glucose levels and even send this data to a healthcare facility. </span></b></li>
<li>Brain Swelling Sensors. <span style="font-weight: 400;">These tiny sensors are implanted within the cranium to help brain surgeons keep track of severe brain injuries and avoid further deathly swelling. They measure pressure on the brain and are able to dissolve by itself in the body without further medical interference.</span></li>
<li><b>Ingestible Sensors. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prescribed medication is swallowed with a tiny digestible medical sensor that sends a small signal to a wearable receiver on the patient, which, in turn, sends data to  a dedicated smartphone app. This sensor can help doctors ensure patients take their medication at all times. </span></li>
<li><b>Smart video pills. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">smart pill can travel through a patient’s intestinal tract and take pictures as it travels. It can then send the collected information to a wearable device, which in turn would send it to a dedicated smartphone app (or straight to the app). Smart pills can also help visualize the gastrointestinal tract and colon remotely. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of IoT in Healthcare.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT in the healthcare industry has countless benefits. However, the most important is that </span><b>treatment outcomes can be significantly improved or maximized,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the data gathered by IoT healthcare devices is highly accurate, enabling informed decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health facilities and practitioners will be capable of minimizing errors because all patient information can be measured quickly and sent to a board of doctors or a healthcare cloud platform. AI-driven algorithms running on these IoT devices could also help make intelligible decisions or suggestions based on existing data.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16917" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elderly-Patient-at-Hospital-1024x707.jpg" alt="how iot helps in healthcare" width="649" height="448" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elderly-Patient-at-Hospital-1024x707.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elderly-Patient-at-Hospital-300x207.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elderly-Patient-at-Hospital-768x531.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elderly-Patient-at-Hospital-600x415.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elderly-Patient-at-Hospital-450x311.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elderly-Patient-at-Hospital-1000x691.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Elderly-Patient-at-Hospital.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /></p>
<p><b>Another great benefit of IoT in healthcare is reduced costs. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With IoT in healthcare</span><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">non-critical patients will be able to stay at home while various IoT devices monitor and send all important information to the health facility — meaning less hospital stays and doctor visits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With detailed information received from lots of IoT devices, health facilities will also be able to improve their disease management. They’ll have more data in real-time coming in than ever before. Still, this entails a number of challenges.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges of IoT in Healthcare.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although IoT in healthcare provides many great benefits, there are also some challenges that need to be solved. The Internet of Things Healthcare solutions cannot be considered for implementation without acknowledging these challenges. </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Massive inputs of generated data.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Having thousands of devices in a single healthcare facility and a thousand more sending information from remote locations — all in real-time — will generate huge amounts of data. The data generated from IoT in healthcare will likely make storage requirements grow much higher, from Terabytes to Petabytes. If used properly, AI-driven algorithms and cloud can help make sense of and organize this data, but this approach needs time to mature. So, creating a large-scale IoT healthcare solution will take a lot of time and effort.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>IoT devices will increase the attack surface. <span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT healthcare bring numerous benefits to the industry, but they also create numerous vulnerable security spots. Hackers could log into medical devices connected to the Internet and steal the information —  or even modify it. They can also take a step further and hack an entire hospital network, infecting the IoT devices with the infamous Ransomware virus. That means the hackers will hold patients and their heart-rate monitors, blood pressure readers, and brain scanners as hostages.</span></b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Existing software infrastructure is obsolete. <span style="font-weight: 400;">IT infrastructures in many hospitals are obsolete. They will not allow for proper integration of IoT devices. Therefore, healthcare facilities will need to revamp their IT processes and use new, more modern software. They will also need to take advantage of virtualization (technologies like SDN and NFV), and ultra-fast wireless and mobile networks like Advanced LTE or 5G. </span></b></li>
</ol>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why The Internet Of Medical Things Is The Future Of Healthcare? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT in healthcare industry can improve components, such as medical gadgets or services. It can also enhance healthcare applications, such as telemedicine, patient monitoring, medication management, imaging, and overall workflows in hospitals.It can also create new ways of treating different diseases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Internet of Things for healthcare will not only be used by hospitals or facilities, but also by surgical centers, research organizations, and even governmental institutions. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future of IoT in Healthcare</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT in healthcare industry does not stand alone. All IoT devices and their networks need to be combined with other technologies to help healthcare facilities transform in a meaningful way. As mentioned before, IoT will revolutionize the healthcare industry but it also needs data, high-speed communication, and proper security and compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5G will provide the ultra-low latency speeds and mobility that the IoT in the healthcare industry needs. In turn, AI-driven solutions will make sense of the data lakes gathered from a collection of devices. Big Data strategies will use such AI algorithms to analyze data in real-time and make critical health decisions. Virtualization will help to reduce or get rid of old infrastructure in hospitals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT is already using most of these technologies to help healthcare evolve, and this evolution will only continue. Sooner than later, healthcare and Internet of Things will become inseparable, completely transforming how we approach our healthcare.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 2016, a hacker found a vulnerability on a specific model of security cameras. Nearly 300,000 Internet of Things (IoT) video recorders started to attack multiple social network websites and brought down Twitter and other high-profile platforms, for almost two hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This attack is just an example of what can happen to IoT devices with poor security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not only video cameras, but anything with an internet connection, from a refrigerator, smart locks, thermostats, lightbulbs, vehicles, and even smart toys. Using them always poses IoT security challenges and risks to overcome.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16632" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IoT-security-challenges.png" alt="IoT security challenges" width="960" height="624" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IoT-security-challenges.png 960w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IoT-security-challenges-300x195.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IoT-security-challenges-768x499.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IoT-security-challenges-600x390.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IoT-security-challenges-450x293.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT Security Challenges</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it is not only us with our computers, but there are also “things” that interact with the Internet without our intervention. These “things” are continually communicating with the Internet, a fridge sending an update of the food inside or our vehicle transmitting messages to the mechanic to inform its oil levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT is wonderful in many ways. But unfortunately, technology has not matured yet, and it is not entirely safe. The entire IoT environment, from manufacturers to users, still have many security challenges of IoT to overcome, such as: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manufacturing standards </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical hardening </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users knowledge and awareness </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top IoT Security Risks</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning to what happened in 2016, the lack of compliance on the part of IoT manufacturers led to weak and unprotected passwords in some IoT video cameras, which, in turn, led to one of the most damaging botnet attacks, the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirai malware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are many IoT security threats, but we will be highlighting the most important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following </span><b>security issues with IoT can be classified as a cause or effect.</b></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) Lack of Compliance on the part of IoT Manufacturers </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New IoT devices come out almost daily, all with undiscovered vulnerabilities. </span><b>The primary source of most IoT security issues is that manufacturers do not spend enough time and resources on security. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, most </span><a href="https://www.av-test.org/en/news/fitness-trackers-13-wearables-in-a-security-test/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fitness trackers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Bluetooth remain visible after the first pairing, a </span><a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/2976270/smart-refrigerator-hack-exposes-gmail-login-credentials.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smart refrigerator can expose Gmail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> login credentials, and a smart fingerprint padlock can be accessed with a Bluetooth key that has the same MAC address as the padlock device.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is precisely one of the biggest security issues with IoT. While there is a lack of universal IoT security standards, manufacturers will continue creating devices with poor security. Manufacturers that started to add Internet connection to their devices do not always have the “security” concept as the crucial element in their product design process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following are some security risks in IoT devices from manufacturers: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weak, guessable, or hard-coded passwords</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardware issues</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of a secure update mechanism</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old and unpatched embedded operating systems and software</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insecure data transfer and storage</span></li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16633" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IoT-Security-Issues.jpg" alt="IoT Security Issues" width="659" height="439" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IoT-Security-Issues.jpg 512w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IoT-Security-Issues-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IoT-Security-Issues-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A smart thermostat</span></i></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) Lack of User Knowledge &amp; Awareness.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Internet users have learnt how to avoid spam or phishing emails, perform virus scans on their PCs, and secure their WiFi networks with strong passwords. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But IoT is a new technology, and people still do not know much about it. While most of the risks of IoT security issues are still on the manufacturing side, users and businesses processes can create bigger threats. One of the biggest IoT security risks and challenges is the user’s ignorance and lack of awareness of the IoT functionality. As a result, everybody is put at risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tricking a human is, most of the time, the easiest way to gain access to a network. A type of IoT security risk that is often overlooked is </span><b>social engineering attacks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead of targeting devices, a hacker targets a human, using the IoT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social engineering was used in the 2010 </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuxnet attack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against a nuclear facility in Iran. The attack was directed to industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which also fall into an IoT device category. The attack corrupted 1,000 centrifuges and made the plant explode. It is believed that the internal network was isolated from the public network to avoid attacks, but all it took was a worker to plug a USB flash drive into one of the internal computers. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3) IoT Security Problems in Device Update Management </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another source of IoT security risks is insecure software or firmware. Although a manufacturer can sell a device with the latest software update, it is almost inevitable that new vulnerabilities will come out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updates are critical for maintaining security on IoT devices. They should be updated right after new vulnerabilities are discovered. Still, as compared with smartphones or computers that get automatic updates, some IoT devices continue being used without the necessary updates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another risk is that during an update, a device will send its backup out to the cloud and will suffer a short downtime. If the connection is unencrypted and the update files are unprotected, a hacker could steal sensitive information.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4) Lack of Physical Hardening </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of physical hardening can also cause IoT security issues. Although some IoT devices should be able to operate autonomously without any intervention from a user, they need to be physically secured from outer threats. Sometimes, these devices can be located in remote locations for long stretches of time, and they could be physically tampered with, for example using a USB flash drive with Malware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring the physical security of an IoT device begins from the manufacturer. But building secure sensors and transmitters in the already low-cost devices is a challenging task for manufacturers nonetheless. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users are also responsible for keeping IoT devices physically secured. A smart motion sensor or a video camera that sits outside a house could be tampered with if not properly protected.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5) Botnet Attacks</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single IoT device infected with malware does not pose any real threat; it is a collection of them that can bring down anything. To perform a botnet attack, a hacker creates an army of bots by infecting them with malware and directs them to send thousands of requests per second to bring down the target. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the uproar about IoT security began after the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirai bot attack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2016. Multiple DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks using hundreds of thousands of IP cameras, NAS, and home routers were infected and directed to bring down the DNS that provided services to platforms like GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, and Airbnb. </span></p>
<p><b>The problem is that IoT devices are highly vulnerable to Malware attacks.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They do not have the regular software security updates that a computer has. So they are quickly turned into </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">infected zombies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and used as weapons to send incredibly vast amounts of traffic.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16634" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-issues-with-iot.png" alt="security issues with iot" width="499" height="374" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-issues-with-iot.png 432w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-issues-with-iot-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is more, a botnet can pose a security threat for electrical grids, manufacturing plants, transportation systems, and water treatment facilities, which can threaten big groups of people. For example, a hacker could trigger a cooling and heating system at the same time, creating spikes on the power grid; in case of a big-scale attack, hackers can create a nation-wide power outtage. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6) Industrial Espionage &amp; Eavesdropping </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If hackers take over surveillance in at location by infecting IoT devices, spying might not be the only option They can also perform such attacks to demand ransom money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus,</span><b> invading privacy is another prominent IoT security issue</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Spying and intruding through IoT devices is a real problem, as a lot different sensitive data may be compromised and used against its owner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a basic level, a hacker might want to take over a camera and use it for spying. Still, one should not forget that many IoT devices record user information, whether it is health equipment, smart toys, wearables, etc. On an industrial level, a company’s big data that can be collected by hackers to expose sensitive business information.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some countries are starting to ban specific IoT devices with security problems. For example, the </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/17/515775874/banned-in-germany-kids-doll-is-labeled-an-espionage-device?t=1555915441376" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interactive IoT doll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a Bluetooth pin, which gave access to the toy’s microphone and speaker to </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">anyone within the 25-30 meter radius. The doll was labeled as an </span><b>espionage device</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and was banned in Germany. </span></p>
<h3><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">7) Highjacking Your IoT Devices. </span></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransomware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been named as one of the nastiest malware types ever existed. Ransomware does not destroy your sensitive files — it blocks access to them by way of encryption. Then, the hacker who infected the device will demand a ransom fee for the decryption key unlocking the files.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is how a ransomware notice looks like:</span><b><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16635" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-challenges-of-iot-1024x576.jpg" alt="security challenges of iot" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-challenges-of-iot-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-challenges-of-iot-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-challenges-of-iot-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-challenges-of-iot-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-challenges-of-iot-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-challenges-of-iot-1000x563.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-challenges-of-iot.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransomware is evolving, and IoT devices with poor security can become targets as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just before the Trump inauguration speech, about</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/romanian-hackers-took-over-dc-surveillance-cameras-just-before-presidential-inauguration-federal-prosecutors-say/2017/12/28/7a15f894-e749-11e7-833f-155031558ff4_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.ca159c557267" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 70% of the Washington DC surveillance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cameras were infected with ransomware, leaving the police without the ability to record for several days.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cases of IoT devices being infected with ransomware are rare, but the concept is quickly becoming a trend in the black hat hacker world. Still, wearables, healthcare gadgets, smart homes, and other smart devices and ecosystems might be at risk in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, the are good news, and there are bad news. While this malware might not have valuable data to lock down because most IoT information is stored in the cloud, it can ock down the entire device’s functionality. Imagine that your vehicle will not start unless you pay a ransom fee — or your house is locked down, with the thermostat set to the maximum. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8) Data Integrity Risks of IoT Security in Healthcare</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With IoT, data is always on the move. It is being transmitted, stored, and processed. Most IoT devices extract and collect information from the external environment. It can be a smart thermostat, HVAC, TVs, medical devices. But sometimes these devices send the collected data to the cloud without any encryption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, a hacker can gain access to a medical IoT device, gaining control over it and being able to alter the data it collects. A controlled medical IoT device can be used to send false signals, which in turn can make health practitioners take actions that may damage the health of their patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a hacked medical IoT device can report a fully charged battery to the maintenance station while in reality the battery is about to die. Worse, there are risks of IoT security in healthcare devices like pacemakers or the ones making the insulin shots. The vulnerabilities found on </span><a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/technology/fda-st-jude-cardiac-hack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. Jude Medical&#8217;s implantable cardiac</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gave access to hackers, enabling them to alter the pacing or shocks, or even worse, deplete the battery. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">9) Rogue IoT Devices</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We might already know about the rapid growth of the number of IoT devices, which is predicted to reach 18 billion by 2022, according to </span><a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/networks/trending/hot-topics/iot-connectivity/iot-market-outlook" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ericsson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The problem with this number of devices arises not only in the BYOD (Bring-Your-On-Devices) approach in enterprises, but also in home networks. One of the most significant IoT security risks and challenges is being able to manage all our devices and close the perimeter.</span></p>
<p><b>But rogue devices or counterfeit malicious IoT devices are beginning to be installed in secured networks without authorization. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rogue device replaces an original one or integrates as a member of a group to collect or alter sensitive information. These devices break the network perimeter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16636" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-risks-in-iot.jpg" alt="security risks in iot" width="960" height="591" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-risks-in-iot.jpg 960w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-risks-in-iot-300x185.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-risks-in-iot-768x473.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-risks-in-iot-600x369.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/security-risks-in-iot-450x277.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raspberry Pi board </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example of rouge IoT devices can take the form of the </span><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raspberry Pi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://www.wifipineapple.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WiFi Pineapple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These can be turned into a rogue AP (Access Point), thermostat, video camera, or MITM (Man in the Middle) and intercept incoming data communications unbeknownst to users. Other variations of rogue devices may also emerge in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, the upcoming horror movie “Child’s Play” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/childs-play-trailer-chucky-smart-home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">was inspired by the concept</a></span> and can serve as a curious example. In the movie, controlling other devices in a smart home system, Chucky is a rouge IoT device that has become a high-level threat to people’s lives.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">10) Cryptomining with IoT Bots.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mining cryptocurrency demands colossal CPU and GPU resources, and another IoT security issue has emerged due to this precondition — cryptomining with IoT bots. This type of attack involves infected botnets aimed at IoT devices, with the goal not to create damage, but mine cryptocurrency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The open-source cryptocurrency </span><a href="https://www.getmonero.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the first ones to be mined using infected IoT devices, such as video cameras. Although a video camera does not have powerful resources to mine cryptocurrency, an army of them does. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT botnet miners pose a great threat to the crypto market, as the have the potential to flood and disrupt the entire market in a single attack. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Mirai attack, people realized that any device connected to the Internet is a potential ally for an army of bots. But that was only the beginning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, IoT and security are still not found in the same place. There are still many risks and security challenges of IoT now — and more will inevitably emerge in the coming years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more variations of IoT devices we see out there, the more complex IoT security problems will become. International organizations and governments will need to create universal IoT standards to control the security in cities, homes, locations like nuclear plants, the manufacturing process, and other areas and locations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have seen the emergence of IoT as a trend in the last few years. There are smart devices coming out that we never thought needed an Internet connection: smart toothbrushes, beauty mirrors, tables, pillows, beds, and the list continues to grow. The world is turning into a network of objects collecting our personal, sensitive information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can only imagine the amount of important data hackers could steal from those IoT devices if they do not have proper security. So, the top IoT security threats listed above are just the beginning. If we want our devices smart, we need them to be secure as well.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how many innovative products have seen the light of our tech-filled days, one thing remains unchanged — in the B2C universe, consumers reach for simple yet mesmerizing innovation with a sky-high “cool and trendy” factor, with useful and simple being almost as important. This is the type of product Adero has built for its customers and earned it a top spot in the much-coveted Fast Company rating.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.adero.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, formerly TrackR, whose shareholders include Amazon, Foundry and Revolution, developed a series of products and software solutions along with Activefield, a platform that can scale across many products, many companies and unlimited use cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adero, being a well-funded startup, has been successfully reinventing itself to stay relevant as it grows together with its addressable market. Like any early stage ventures, one of Adero’s challenges hinged on a need to scale its software development together with its engineering bandwidth, with the required growth vs. available local resources.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competing in a rather fragmented market of IoT-based consumer solutions for organizations, Adero aimed high, worked hard, and raced against time to go to market with an offering that would win over millennial and Generation X consumers alike.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During its quest, Adero partnered with Intellectsoft, which was able to integrate its efforts smoothly into the strides undertaken by Adero’s in-house team. Understanding  IoT technologies, the intricacies of hardware design and embedded software, coupled with an innate understanding of the needs and wants of Adero’s core consumers, Intellectsoft was able to contribute its skills and knowledge to the partnership, resulting in a product that lies at the core of the intelligent, easy and stress-free organization concept of Adero. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after the product’s release, Fast Company awarded Adero the #10 spot on their list of Most Innovative Companies, alongside tech giants Apple, Google and Microsoft.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">About Adero &amp; Smart Tagging System</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adero (formerly known as TrackR) is a Santa Barbara, CA-based technology company that provides an intelligent organization system aiming to end the stress and chaos that comes with managing personal things. Converging consumer electronics, hardware, the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, software, and wireless in one place, Adero’s </span><b>Smart Tagging</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system lets a user’s life essentials manage and keep track of themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16580" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adero-3.jpg" alt="Adero" width="625" height="476" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adero-3.jpg 817w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adero-3-300x228.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adero-3-768x585.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adero-3-600x457.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adero-3-450x343.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>1 Smart Tag (parent beacon) and 3 Taglets (smaller beacons) connected to it</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how many things you have and the number of bags you use to carry them, Adero is built to ensure you never lose anything in a simple way. The logic behind Adero’s product is the following. The Smart Tagging system consists of small tracking devices, parent trackers, and a custom mobile app. You place the parent beacon (called a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Tag</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) on a bag, the smaller trackers (called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taglets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) on the things you usually put in that bag, and then register the bag and its tags in the mobile app. When you leave something from the bag behind, the app sends you a notification after communicating with trackers. You can organise the bags, trackers, and notifications in the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How hard was the road to the seamlessly working final product and the customer? And where did Intellectsoft step in to play the part?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges, Challenges, Challenges</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the start, Adero faced fierce competition in the tracking solutions market. The only option was creating a pitch-perfect product that would fully deliver on the premise of keeping track of personal belongings at all times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final result needed to be simple, work seamlessly, and stand out among competitors. Adero’s talented team had experience  creating similar products that enjoyed success, including the wireless speaker system from Sonos, XBox from Microsoft and the Tesla.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16581" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-4.32.09-PM.png" alt="Adero" width="501" height="602" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-4.32.09-PM.png 571w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-4.32.09-PM-250x300.png 250w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-4.32.09-PM-375x450.png 375w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The accompanying mobile app is an important part of Adero&#8217;s product</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adero began working with various development partners focusing on design, firmware, hardware, and software. The two unresolved pieces of the fully-developed product puzzle were: a) ensuring interoperability between all product components and b) simplicity of the solution that would resonate with users of diverse tastes, age groups and abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those tasks Adero selected Intellectsoft to partner across mobile, cloud, and microservices development. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building the Team &amp; Getting to Work</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the right expertise and niche skills were critical to the product development success, contracting planned time to market put both companies under significant pressure to perform fast and, most importantly, to deliver robust and superb performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Intellectsoft such a time-pressed environment is actually a modus operandi, as many domestic and foreign enterprise clients come to Intellectsoft “in a pinch.” The company has a well-oiled system of acquiring, training and onboarding the resources with required core domain and technology prowess and compiling an outstanding team within Adero-required deadline.  Intellectsoft has been working with Adero through a combination model from its offshore development centers in Kyiv and Minsk, as well as on-site in a client-facing capacity at Adero’s offices in Santa Barbara. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project epitomised success of this close collaboration between Intellectsoft and Adero teams that enjoyed great synergies in the process, consisting of knowledge sharing across a wide array of subjects from general technology challenges to particular relevant  intricacies in software development. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Big data analytics emerged as a requisite for the success of business and technology. That is why we now have various big data frameworks in the market to choose from. Apache Spark and Hadoop are two of such big data frameworks, popular due to their efficiency and applications. While we do have a choice, picking up the right one has become quite difficult. Perhaps, performing a downright comparison of the pros and cons of these tools would be no good as well, since this will not highlight the particular usefulness of a tool. Instead, this article performs a detailed Apache Spark vs Hadoop MapReduce comparison, highlighting their performance, architecture, and use cases.</p>



<p>Before delving into a detailed comparison, we will briefly explore what Spark and Hadoop are.</p>



<p>Let’s start exploring the frameworks.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Apache Spark</strong></h2>



<p>Apache Spark is a real-time data analytics framework that mainly executes in-memory computations in a distributed environment. It offers incredible processing speed, making it desirable for everyone interested in big data analytics. <a href="https://spark.apache.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Spark</a> can either work as a stand-alone tool or can be associated with Hadoop YARN. Since it flaunts faster data processing, it is suitable for repeated processing of data sets. Nonetheless, it requires more power.</p>



<h2><strong>What is MapReduce, or Hadoop MapReduce</strong></h2>



<p>MapReduce is what constitutes the core of <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Apache Hadoop</a>, which is an open source framework. The MapReduce programming model lets Hadoop first store and then process big data in a distributed computing environment. This makes it capable of processing large data sets, particularly when RAM is less than data. Hadoop does not have the speed of Spark, so it works best for economical operations not requiring immediate results.</p>



<h2><strong>Hadoop MapReduce vs Spark – Detailed Comparison</strong></h2>



<p>Both Spark and Hadoop serve as big data frameworks, seemingly fulfilling the same purposes. However, they have several differences in the way they approach data processing. Here, we draw a comparison of the two from various viewpoints.</p>



<h2><strong>Spark vs MapReduce Performance</strong></h2>



<p>At a glance, anyone can randomly label Spark a winner considering the data processing speed. Nonetheless, delving into the details of the performance of Hadoop and Spark reveals more facts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-16351" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-1024x455.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-1024x455.jpeg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-300x133.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-768x341.jpeg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-600x267.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-450x200.jpeg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop-1000x444.jpeg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Apache-Spark-vs-Hadoop.jpeg 1049w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Spark vs Hadoop big data analytics visualisation</em></p>



<h3><strong>Apache Spark Performance</strong></h3>



<p>As said above, Spark is faster than Hadoop. This is because of its in-memory processing of the data, which makes it suitable for real-time analysis. Nonetheless, it requires a lot of memory since it involves caching until the completion of a process. So, if the data fits well into memory, Spark can become the right option.</p>



<h3><strong>MapReduce Performance</strong></h3>



<p>Hadoop processes data by first storing it across a distributed environment, and then processing it in parallel. The software is basically designed to process data gathered from various sources. Thus, it takes quite some time to show results. In other words, Hadoop should not be considered for data processing where faster results are needed.</p>



<p>However, if speed and time are not critical, then Hadoop outperforms Spark Apache as it conveniently handles large data sets, is capable of handling hardware failures, and does not require a lot of processing memory. Besides, unlike Spark, it does not require caching, thus saving up memory.</p>



<h2><strong>Hadoop vs </strong><strong>Apache Spark Language</strong></h2>



<p>Hadoop MapReduce and Spark not only differ in performance but are also written in different languages. Hadoop is usually written in Java that supports MapReduce functionalities. Nonetheless, Python may also be used if required.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Apache Spark is mainly written in Scala. But‎, it also comes with APIs for ‎Java‎, ‎Python‎, R, and SQL. Hence, it offers more options to the developers.</p>



<h2><strong>Spark and MapReduce Architecture</strong></h2>



<p>Spark and MapReduce both perform data analytics in a distributed computing environment. However, both the software process a given dataset differently. Below we explain and compare the architecture when it comes to Spark vs MapReduce.</p>



<h3><strong>Apache Spark Architecture</strong></h3>



<p>Spark is a clustered computing system that has RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) as its fundamental data structure. This data structure makes Spark resilient to faults and failure when processing data distributed over multiple nodes and managing partitioned datasets of values. It is RDD’s capability to exploit the power of multiple nodes in a cluster that makes it faster and tolerant to faults.</p>



<p>While executing data analysis, Spark Apache manages the distribution of datasets over various nodes in a cluster, creating RDDs. RDD is an immutable collection of objects that may be lazily transformed via Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Each dataset in an RDD is divided into multiple logical partitions facilitating in parallel computation across different nodes in the cluster.</p>



<p>Inside the cluster, the <em>master node</em> holds the driver program where the Spark Context is created for smooth execution of all Spark functionalities. The Spark Context collaborates with the <em>Cluster Manager</em> to manage a task. Besides, the Spark architecture also consists of <em>Worker Nodes</em> that hold data cache, perform task execution, and return the results to the Spark Context. The number of Worker Nodes may be increased as desired for faster processing. However, it will require more space.</p>



<h3><strong>Apache Spark Architecture Diagram</strong></h3>



<p>The following diagram illustrates Spark architecture. Whenever an RDD is created in the Spark Context, it is then further distributed to the <em>Worker Nodes</em> for task execution alongside caching. The Worker Nodes, after task execution, send the results back to the Spark Context.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-16217" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spark-architecture.png" alt="Apache Spark Architecture" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spark-architecture.png 596w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spark-architecture-300x144.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spark-architecture-450x216.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></figure>



<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Apache Spark architecture</em></p>



<h3><strong>Hadoop MapReduce Architecture</strong></h3>



<p>Hadoop comprises of two core components – HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator). As the name implies, HDFS manages big data storage across multiple nodes; while YARN manages processing tasks by resource allocation and job scheduling.</p>



<p>The HDFS architecture is based on two main nodes – a <em>NameNode</em>, and multiple <em>DataNodes</em>. These nodes exhibit a master/slave architecture where a NameNode serves as the master managing storage and logging changes to the metadata of all files in a cluster. While the DataNodes are the slave nodes that perform NameNode’s commands.</p>



<p>YARN also comprises of two major components that manage the core functions of resource management and task scheduling. These are the <em>Resource Manager</em> and the <em>Node Managers</em>. Resource Manager is a cluster-level component (there can only be one per cluster), whereas Node Managers exist at the node level, making up several NodeManagers in a cluster.</p>



<h3><strong>Hadoop </strong><strong>MapReduce Diagram</strong></h3>



<p>The following diagram shows the architecture of Hadoop HDFS. The NameNode saves the metadata of all stored files as well as logs any changes to the metadata. Whereas, the DataNodes store the actual data, attend read/write requests and performs NameNode’s instructions regarding creation, deletion, or replication of blocks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-16218" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hadoop-HDFS-architecture-1.png" alt="apache spark vs mapreduce" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hadoop-HDFS-architecture-1.png 874w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hadoop-HDFS-architecture-1-300x185.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hadoop-HDFS-architecture-1-768x474.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hadoop-HDFS-architecture-1-600x370.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hadoop-HDFS-architecture-1-450x278.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px" /></figure>



<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Hadoop HDFS architecture</em></p>



<p>In YARN architecture, the Resource Manager allocates resources for running apps in a cluster via <em>Scheduler</em>. Besides, its ApplicationManager component accepts job submissions and negotiates for app execution with the first container.</p>



<p>Node Managers manage containers and track resource utilization. NodeManagers also communicate with ResourceManager for updates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-16219" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hadoop-YARN-architecture.png" alt="mapreduce architecture" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hadoop-YARN-architecture.png 559w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hadoop-YARN-architecture-300x214.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hadoop-YARN-architecture-450x321.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px" /></figure>



<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Hadoop YARN architecture</em></p>



<h2><strong>Hadoop vs Spark</strong><strong> Cost </strong></h2>



<p>In general, both Hadoop and Spark are free open-source software. However, developing the associated infrastructure may entail software development costs. From the viewpoint of Hadoop vs Apache Spark budget, Hadoop seems a cost-effective means for data analytics. It requires less RAM and can even work on commodity hardware.</p>



<p>Spark, on the other hand, requires more RAM since it works faster and does not consume disk I/O. So, it may require pricey systems. However, as it boasts advanced technology, it requires less computation units, and this may lower the costs.</p>



<h2><strong>Spark vs MapReduce</strong><strong> Compatibility</strong></h2>



<p>Spark and Hadoop MapReduce are identical in terms of compatibility. While both can work as stand-alone applications, one can also run Spark on top of Hadoop YARN. Spark also supports Hadoop InputFormat data sources, thus showing compatibility with almost all Hadoop-supported file formats.</p>



<p>Likewise, Hadoop can also be integrated with various tools like Sqoop and Flume.</p>



<h2><strong>Apache Spark</strong><strong> And Hadoop Security </strong></h2>



<p>Spark supports authentication via shared secret. Its security features also include event logging, and it uses <em>javax servlet</em> filters for securing web user interface. Nevertheless, if it runs on YARN and integrates with HDFS, it may also leverage the potential of HDFS file permissions, Kerberos, and inter-node encryption.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-16220" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Comparing-security-of-Spark-vs-Hadoop.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Comparing-security-of-Spark-vs-Hadoop.jpg 960w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Comparing-security-of-Spark-vs-Hadoop-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Comparing-security-of-Spark-vs-Hadoop-768x461.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Comparing-security-of-Spark-vs-Hadoop-600x360.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Comparing-security-of-Spark-vs-Hadoop-450x270.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></figure>



<p>On the other hand, Hadoop surpasses Apache Spark in terms of security, as it supports Kerberos authentication. While Kerberos may be difficult to handle, Hadoop also supports third-party authentication, such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It also offers conventional file permissions, encryption, and access control lists (ACLs). Besides, it ensures providing appropriate user permissions for a job with Service Level Authorization (SLA). Here, Hadoop surpasses Spark in terms of security features.</p>



<h2><strong>MapReduce Vs Spark</strong><strong> Use Cases</strong></h2>



<p>While Apache Spark and Hadoop process big data in different ways, both the frameworks provide different benefits, and thus, have different use cases.</p>



<h3><strong>Apache Spark Use Cases</strong></h3>



<p>Spark, being the faster, is suitable for processes where quick results are needed. Hence, Spark fits best for:</p>



<ol>
<li>Real-time analysis of big data</li>
<li>Fast data processing with immediate results</li>
<li>Iterative operations</li>
<li>Machine Learning algorithms</li>
<li>Graph processing</li>
</ol>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Hadoop MapReduce Use Cases</strong></h3>



<p>As noted above, comparing processing speeds of Apache Spark vs MapReduce gives Spark an edge over Hadoop. However, Hadoop exhibits tremendous capability of processing large data sets. Hence, it works best for:</p>



<ol>
<li>Analysis of archive data</li>
<li>Operations involving commodity hardware</li>
<li>Data analysis where time factor is not essential</li>
<li>Linear data processing of large datasets</li>
</ol>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Spark And Hadoop Examples</strong></h2>



<p>By comparing MapReduce vs Spark practical examples, one can easily get an idea of how these two giant frameworks are supporting big data analysis on large scale.</p>



<h3><strong>Apache Spark Examples</strong></h3>



<ol>
<li>Risk management and forecasting</li>
<li>Industrial analysis of big data gathered from sensors for predictive maintenance of equipment</li>
<li>Fraud detection and prevention with real-time analysis</li>
<li>Delivering more tailored customer experiences by analyzing data related to customer behavioral patterns</li>
<li>Predicting stock market trends with real-time predictive analysis of stock portfolio movements</li>
</ol>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>MapReduce Examples</strong></h3>



<ol>
<li>Social networking platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn use MapReduce for data analyses</li>
<li>Law enforcement and security agencies use Hadoop for processing huge datasets of criminal activities gathered over a period of time for crime prevention</li>
<li>Finance, telecom, and health sectors rely on Hadoop for periodic analysis of big data to fuel future operations based on the gather customer reviews</li>
<li>Improvement of science research with data analysis</li>
<li>Data analysis by city and state governments for improving overall infrastructure, such as by analyzing data related to traffic situations</li>
</ol>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Hadoop MapReduce Or </strong><strong>Apache Spark</strong><strong> – Which One Is Better?</strong></h2>



<p>Considering the overall Apache Spark benefits, many see the framework as a replacement for Hadoop. Perhaps, that’s the reason why we see an exponential increase in the popularity of Spark during the past few years.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the outlined comparison clarifies that both Apache Spark and Hadoop have advantages and disadvantages. Though both frameworks are used for data processing, they have significant differences with regards to their approach to data analytics. Both of them are designed in different languages and have distinct use cases. Therefore, it purely depends on the users which one to choose based on their preferences and project requirements.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/solutions/internet-of-things" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet of Things (IoT)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology might not astonish anyone like Virtual or Augmented Reality does at first glance, but its potential is more far-reaching for both consumers and businesses. Coupled with cloud and other technologies, IoT connects devices big and small to transform products, operations, and entire businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does it happen? We selected IoT software development examples of different scale from our own projects to show the impact of IoT in detail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s see how a luxury hotel chain, vending machine provider, and retail solutions company added the prefix “smart” to their businesses. </span></p>
<h2><b>Types of IoT Software Development Services &amp; Solutions</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before exploring the cases, let’s stop at the types of IoT software development and solutions for valuable context. They range in scale, complexity, and enabling hardware. </span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Embedded software development</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involves creating software that would control other machines or devices. Examples of embedded software development applications include smart hotel systems where guests can use a tablet to control room amenities; next-generation vending machines with tables; interactive displays; and smart car systems. </span></li>
<li><b> Firmware development for Android</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. IoT development solutions like a smart room tablet, vending machine, or interactive display need their own Android firmware. This allows for building a custom launcher, connecting external sensors needed for a given solution, enforcing custom security policies, porting the latest Android OS, and enabling over-the-air updates and device monitoring.</span></li>
<li><b> Indoor &amp; outdoor navigation systems</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> primarily involve </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/what-are-beacons-and-how-do-they-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beacon technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and mobile devices. Beacons are small devices that send messages via Bluetooth to mobile devices, providing navigation, contextual experiences (for example information about a location an individual just entered), as well as ads and critical notifications. </span></li>
<li><b> Industrial IoT solutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This solutions allow enterprises monitor operations with sensors to gather various types of data, inform about inconsistencies and emergencies, and get a wholesome view of operations. </span></li>
<li><b> Enterprise IoT solutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> combine different types of IoT software development and hardware in scalable IoT ecosystems. </span></li>
<li><b> Custom IoT solutions </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">solutions built from scratch for specific purposes or as a product. </span></li>
</ol>
<h2><b>Enterprise IoT Solution — Smart Hotel System</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their first experience of outsourcing software development, an award-winning Asian hotel chain turned to Intellectsoft for a smart hotel system for its new, ambitious luxury hotel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system would have a tablet app that allows guests to control amenities, access resort information, and drive sales. The project involved embedded software development and Android custom firmware development.</span></p>
<p><b>Challenge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company’s new hotel offers a range of suites of different size, from multi-bedroom suites to two-story villas. Each of them has a different set of amenities. We needed to create a universal tablet experience that would adapt to suite type and extend the chain’s unmatched hotel experience to the tablet. </span></p>
<p><b>Solution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our team created an Android app with pre-set designs for each suite type. In eye-pleasing and uncluttered UX, guests can control light, air conditioning, windows, TV, and media devices in all rooms. They also can use the app to order guest services, chat with stuff, receive notifications, and access important information (restaurant and in-room menus, entertainment, flight schedules, and other).  </span></p>
<p><b><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15215" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Internet-of-Things-Software-Development-1.png" alt="Internet of Things Development" width="745" height="559" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Internet-of-Things-Software-Development-1.png 812w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Internet-of-Things-Software-Development-1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Internet-of-Things-Software-Development-1-768x576.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Internet-of-Things-Software-Development-1-600x450.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Internet-of-Things-Software-Development-1-450x338.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /></b></p>
<p><b>Impact.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Regardless of scale, successful IoT development requires the right expertise and effort. After working closely with the client on and off site, our smart hotel solution ensured a smooth opening day for the client’s one-of-the-kind resort and became essential to the hotel experience. Our partnership continues in Internet of Things development (beacon technology) as well as extending to solutions with other tech. </span></p>
<h2><b>Android Custom Firmware Development &amp; Embedded Software Development — Smart Fridges</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it is a scalable Industrial IoT ecosystem or a solution of a much smaller scale, Internet of Things development often provides a foundation for a business. Our solution for Californian vending machine provider is a handy illustration of that.</span></p>
<p><b>Challenge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company provides offices around the U.S. with healthy food from local brands in smart fridges. Aiming to make the user experience as simple as possible, the company approached Intellectsoft to elevate the existing solution further up. The new solution also needed to have smooth integration with card readers and RFID antennas. In other words, the company’s smart fridges needed to be a perfect example of what a frictionless user experience is. </span></p>
<p><b>Solution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our designer team put together a questionnaire, dived deep on the subject of vending machines and how they work, and explored cases when tablets were used with hardware in the client’s niche and similar markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team’s work resulted in Android tablet solution with unique, three-step UX: a user chooses a food item, swipes their card, and takes the item out of the fridge — as simple as that. The software engineers on the team ensured the simplicity and speed by establishing fail-safe </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">communication between the system, the card readers, and the RFID tags. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15216" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-1024x1024.jpg" alt="IoT software development" width="583" height="583" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Fridge-Tablet-1000x1000.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Fridge-Tablet.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To speed up the UX further, the solution involved no third-party software onboard. As embedded system software development allows for remote monitoring and over-the-air updates, the company could always manage their fleet of fridges and ensure the tablets are consistently updated. </span></p>
<p><b>Impact</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Over the years, the result of our Internet of Things development continues to be a reliable foundation for the company’s business. Our partnership continues to this day. </span></p>
<h2><b>Indoor Positioning System with Android App &amp; Embedded Software Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As beacons started emerging several years ago, the retail industry was first in the queue to implement them. Hidden from plain sight, these small, cost-effective devices were set to help retailers breath new life into the in-store experience along with mobile apps. Right at that moment, a company specializing in IT solutions for retail got in touch with Intellectsoft for an indoor positioning system and Internet of Things software development. </span></p>
<p><b>Challenge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The solution needed to locate the user on premises and supply them with promotional information. The GPS option was excluded. </span></p>
<p><b>Solution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As Beacons rely on Bluetooth technology, the devices were the perfect fit for the project. We designed an indoor positioning system were beacons are strategically placed to accommodate the user experience and drive sales. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15217" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1159797838.jpg" alt="Embedded software development" width="553" height="369" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1159797838.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1159797838-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1159797838-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1159797838-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1159797838-450x301.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make everything work, we added a mobile app to the equation. Our IoT software development efforts result in an Android app that allows users create and modify shopping lists with details about the products they are interested in, like name barcode or product category. While creating a list, they can take advantage of prior history, auto-suggestions, loyalty cards, product searches, and favorites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, beacons and app pairing can be used to send location-based individual offers to shoppers: when a user approaches an item they could be interested in, a beacon sends a notification to the app. </span></p>
<p><b>Impact</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As beacons were only emerging back then, our solution gave the company and their clients an edge over competition. The beacon-based indoor positioning system supplied customers with individual notifications, opening up new marketing avenues for retailers, driving sales, and adding value to both customer and in-store experience.</span></p>
<h2><b>Final Notes</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the scale and type of solution, Internet of Things software development can become a solid foundation for a business or a separate operation. Coupled with mobile and other technologies, IoT allows companies to solve existing issues, deliver new experiences, and continuously drive sales.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the years since it emerged, the concept of The Internet of Things (IoT) has travelled from connecting several daily wearables with smartphones to big-scale industrial IoT ecosystems. Small and hidden, IoT devices and sensors are always out of sight, but they are the means to collect Big Data and drive impactful, enterprise-wide decision making. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Rifkin, an American economic and social theorist, who has been advising the European Union and Chancellor Angela Merkel, goes as far as to brand IoT as the universal platform for for </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX3M8Ka9vUA&amp;index=10&amp;list=WL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Third Industrial Revolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Rifkin, humanity is currently transitioning to new forms of communication, energy, and transportation that will operate on the Internet of Things infrastructure globally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading the way are long-established large enterprises across industries that test and implement IoT solutions successfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s see how Amazon, Bosch, Hewlett Packard, and other big brands use enterprise IoT in our selection. </span></p>
<h2><b>IoT Technology Solutions: Bosch and Connected Housing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bosch is one of Europe’s largest electrotechnical and engineering firms. The company is based in Germany and produces various automotive components, manufacturing tools, diagnostics and control mechanisms, and a great many other products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bosch’s recent take on house appliances includes smart connectivity that lets gadgets “talk” to each other and exchange information fast, or machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. For example, smart devices notify house owners, suppliers, or maintenance office about food shortage, electricity overuse, malfunctioning, as well as other information. In some cases, M2M devices can solve an issue on their own. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RR4YrBbIZVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Cisco and IoT Development For Enterprise</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cisco Systems, the world&#8217;s largest network equipment producer for remote access, security services, and storage networks, also didn’t miss the opportunity to leverage the Internet of Things. The company sets forth the IoT benefits for business, and offers broad-scale industrial IoT solutions that help monitor operations, gather Big Data, and optimise overarching business processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See the video:</span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-oLSf0wPE0A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cisco also focuses on fog technologies, which operate between cloud services and the end user. Fog tech significantly speeds up the connection and widens the range of transmitted data. Fog tech will facilitate the adoption of IoT solutions, with 50 billion smart devices connected by 2020, according to McKinsey research. More so, fog technologies will allow for converging IT and operational technologies across organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See Cisco’s panel discussion on IoT system deployments using fog applications:</span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5-a5_TiOnb0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>IoT Solutions in Shopping: Amazon Go</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With their Go shops, Amazon has reimagined grocery shopping by allowing customers to simply walk into the store, take the products they need, and walk out. The shops’ IoT ecosystem relies on many RFID chips, CCTV cameras, and customers’ smartphones connected to their Amazon accounts via a dedicated app, as well as computer vision and deep learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system analyzes what a customer takes and automatically adds it to their virtual cart, processing the payments for the products after they leave the store. The system is also highly responsive. For example, it can identify when a shopper took an item, but decided to put it back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, there are no queues, and the shopping experience is more pleasant, smooth, and efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See the video:</span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NrmMk1Myrxc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Go launched to general public at the start of 2018. There are currently two stores in Seattle, WA.</span></p>
<h2><b>Enterprise Internet of Things: Azure IoT Suite (Microsoft), IoT Hub for Developers</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft’s Azure IoT suite converges IoT, machine learning, business intelligence, and notifications systems to help gather Big Data with IoT devices, as well as drive IoT software and application development.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visualise data in real time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manage device fleet</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azure IoT suite also includes user templates that allow for creating fully customizable solutions for typical IoT scenarios.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ES-1g_mGxY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of Azure IoT Suite, Internet of Things for enterprise solutions can increase equipment reliability with predictive maintenance, connect and monitor devices remotely, improve tracking the operation of devices, assets, and sensors, as well as develop and test IoT solutions with device simulation.</span></p>
<h2><b>IoT in Business: Daimler’s Autonomous Truck-Based Logistics</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Daimler unveiled their Highway Pilot Connect, a truck platooning system of semi-autonomous Mercedes-Benz trucks. The platoon can consist of up to ten vehicle driving in liniar formation and connected by onboard telematics platform using Wi-Fi. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BnBuLkJnHAA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution allows enterprises to drastically optimise their logistics, improve productivity, as well as reduce costs and ecological footprint. In the future, Highway Pilot Connect and similar solutions would help build big, reliable logistics ecosystems that require low human involvement level. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you foresaw the power and potential of the Internet 25 years ago, congratulations. You’re likely reading this from your gold-plated private jet. For the rest of us, even those who remember the clanging bells of a dial-up modem or the robotic voice reminding you that “You’ve got mail,” the Internet seems as natural as the air we breathe. It’s incredible to think how heavily we have come to rely on a technology that didn’t exist a generation ago.</p>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Internet of Things (IoT) is the new Internet. It is the next logical stage in the evolution of data networks. Although you may have missed the nascent stages, it’s by no means too late to get on board. Right now is a pretty darned exciting time to be an app or </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/about" target="_blank">software development company</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your perspective, the Internet of Things is somewhere on a spectrum between Kubrickian horror and technological utopia. A lot of our “things,” like our laptops, phones, tablets, televisions, and fitness trackers, are already a part of the IoT. The gist of the IoT is that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the electronic devices you use – alarm clock, lamp, toothbrush, coffeemaker, car (and that’s just before you get to work) – will be connected to the internet in order to collect and transmit data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is changing. Today’s kids can’t imagine a world without the Internet. Tomorrow’s kids won’t be able to imagine a world without the Internet of Things. And it’s time for a </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services/mobile-development">mobile app development</a> company <span style="font-weight: 400;">to understand the implications of that.</span></p>
<p><b>It’s the way of the future…but it’s still relatively unknown</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re still not sold on the Internet of Things, consider this: Intel, the tech giant which invented the modern day microprocessor, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">predicts that by the year 2020 there will be <a href="https://host.madison.com/wsj/business/tom-still-the-internet-of-things-revolution-is-just-getting/article_be0e928a-7148-5bcd-9b88-7ff2e5c36044.html" target="_blank">200 billion connected devices</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s 200 billion &#8212; as in twice the number of stars in the Milky Way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of factors driving this incredible growth. As technology costs fall, it’s easier for manufacturers to create Wi-Fi capable products. At the same time, smart phones – with Internet connectivity – are becoming the standard communication device. Industry leaders like Apple are already integrating fitness trackers, televisions, and mp3 players into the IoT, with many players expected to follow suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, even with these bold predictions and trends pointing towards the IoT as the next big thing, there’s still not much awareness of the concept among the general public – even those who use it on a daily basis. In fact, according to Forbes magazine,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">87 percent of people either do not understand or have not heard of the Internet of Things (IoT)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>The potential for growth is huge</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a software developer this should sound like music to your ears. As the app store continues to bloat with over one and half million games, trackers, and timewasters, IoT presents a whole new playing field for you to branch out. By comparison, there are only</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1,000 <a href="http://www.knowyourmobile.com/devices/apple-tv-2015/23346/best-apple-tv-apps-right-now" target="_blank">apps offered for the Apple TV</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">10,000 for the <a href="https://www.wareable.com/apple-watch/best-apple-watch-apps-832" target="_blank">Apple Watch</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To break into the IoT, become an expert in a field that’s still untapped. If you spend the next five years with an </span>app development company<span style="font-weight: 400;"> creating software and apps for showers or toaster ovens, chances are no one will know more about your niche than you do. The IoT is so multifaceted that it’s impossible for the major players to cover every device. It’s an absolute goldmine for a </span>custom mobile app development company<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest thing to remember, should your software, app, or other IoT creation take off, is to ensure scalability. While <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services/startups" target="_blank">research and development</a> are important in early stages, it’s important to plan for best-case contingencies. Will you be ready when the order for a million units comes in?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s incredible potential in the IoT so long as you understand how it works and where you can fit in. What a time to be alive!</span></p>
