								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The profound humanitarian fallout of the COVID-19 continues to expand by the day. Governments have launched unprecedented public-health and economic responses. Companies have developed and implemented business continuity plans, security guidance, and, most importantly — seamless remote working conditions. In this article, we offer some of Intellectsoft’s latest insights of managing a team of remote developers during times like this.</p>
<h1><b>How To Manage Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h1>
<p>So here we are, living in a world where pandemic movies came to life. The number of ill people is rising, as well as the level of stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Since March 16, our employees have been working remotely. We have already faced all the possible difficulties on our way and learned how to tackle the main challenges to manage the working process smart and effectively. We are ready to spill the beans and share all the secrets of productive remote management.</p>
<p>To stop COVID-19, all the countries around the world are trying to minimize human interactions, resulting in <strong>a staggering number of employees learning how to work remotely</strong>. Even though the majority of software engineers are not new to work like this, it can still be quite a challenge to manage a team in such difficult times psychologically.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19392 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-scaled.jpg" alt="How To Manage Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>That is why in this article, we are going to shed light on ten tips to organize an effective working process with remote developers, taking into account both psychological pitfalls and practical hurdles to overcome.</p>
<h2><b>How to Manage a Team of Remote Developers Despite the Uncertainty</b></h2>
<p>First and foremost, you need to outline all the possible challenges your software development team may face when working from home. Usually, it boils down to three main challenges. These are communication problems and pitfalls, lack of well-functioned equipment, and the inability to manage productivity.</p>
<p>For this reason, before setting out the rules, guidelines, and software development team goals, make sure you did your best to eliminate or alleviate the possible struggles that may occur.</p>
<h2><b>10 Tips To Keep Your Developers Team Effective During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h2>
<p>Luckily, we have already examined the best cases of smart and efficient remote developers management and prepared a quick guide for you to follow. We have taken into consideration the main challenges that can be difficult to tackle and offering comprehensive solutions to the problem. Take a look and enjoy the tips that truly work.</p>
<h3><b>1. Secure a Well-Functioned Tech Facilities and Tools</b></h3>
<p>Firstly, you need some software that will unite all the working processes. To ensure productivity, you’d better have a look at <strong>various collaboration tools perfect for a software development team working remotely.</strong>  Such tools as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/ru/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jira</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/?&amp;aceid=&amp;adposition=&amp;adgroup=77960797405&amp;campaign=1495118561&amp;creative=389415003358&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=trello&amp;matchtype=e&amp;network=g&amp;placement=&amp;ds_kids=p48956357108&amp;ds_e=GOOGLE&amp;ds_eid=700000001557344&amp;ds_e1=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Iv0BRDaARIsAGTWD1u6J2htFRXh6wNFyzNse_aL_oTmPCvKEjPuVZYAT10fuV645yZsumIaAieOEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trello</a>, <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom</a> enable us to stay focused on daily tasks, plan and manage projects. Slack helps our team to stay connected all the time. It’s the place where we <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/remote-team-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainstorm</a> and solve current issues. And Zoom, as a perfect alternative to Skype, is a way more convenient tool to have video calls and screen sharing.</p>
<p>What is more, there are tons of <a href="https://brainhub.eu/blog/tools-for-remote-development-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity tools</a> that are both efficient and have friendly interfaces like Todoist, iDoneThis, and Atlassian Stash. With the help of such systems, it is much easier to have an overall picture needed when working remotely.</p>
<h3><b>2. Make Sure Your Staff Have Everything for Effective Work</b></h3>
<p>But for the obvious essentials like a well-function computer or a laptop and great Internet connection, one should think through all the possible hurdles on the way to a smooth remote working process. Ensure that you have <strong>a backup to the cloud in case there is any accidental deletion of valuable files. </strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, your workers need to have “<a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/secure-collaboration-remote-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">access</a> to servers, development environments, and shared code.” Otherwise, your software developers teams will just stumble upon inconveniences that could lower their productivity.</p>
<h3><b>3. Think Through Communication Channels</b></h3>
<p>Even though many people hate these real face-to-face meetings, during such gatherings, you can communicate fast, transmit your ideas fast, and, most importantly, solve the existing problems fast. When working with remote developers, it is vital to have <strong>regular video meetings.</strong> Not only will regular conferences reduce the problem with the lack of information, but they also help to unite workers and show they are all in this together.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19388 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-scaled.jpg" alt="Think Through Communication Channels During Coronavirus Crisis" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<h3><b>4. Help Your Workers With Self-Organization</b></h3>
<p>If you want your developers’ team to be productive, you need to show them the importance of <strong>self-organization and discipline</strong>. Teach them to stay online during the working day. What is more, be a great example and don’t bother them with work issues at weekends and when the working day has ended.</p>
<p>Explain that the remote work schedule is no different from work in the office, and this is actually the good news. The reason is simple: you work the same amount of time, but you don’t waste your time commuting, for instance. What is more, psychologically it is less stressful when you do your job within the agreed time period, having no put offs, and then just relax after the work is done.</p>
<h3><b>5. Set Software Development Team Roles and Responsibilities</b></h3>
<p>Make sure both formal and informal roles are distributed effectively so that each employee knows exactly what their responsibilities are. When working remotely, a team <strong>“can truly benefit from having informal roles like various kinds of leaders, idea generators, critics, and doers”</strong>, as it is the key to self-management.</p>
<p>Plus, it is worth mentioning that to maximize productivity, you’d better build small teams of <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/how-manage-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-8 people</a>. Such teams are more autonomous, take responsibility for their initiatives, and as a result, are more efficient. In case you’re developing a big project, you can always divide one team into sub-teams.</p>
<h3><b>6. Keep Everyone Updated</b></h3>
<p>When working together on one project, it is crucial that <strong>all the members are in the loop</strong>, especially in the case of remote developers. For this reason, once again, think through regular conference meetings to discuss the relevant issues. Knowing the status of other projects, or being aware of any changes in the company’s goals and objectives is all crucial to an employee working remotely. That is why ensure that nobody is missing out on anything.</p>
<h3><b>7. Encourage Open Conversation </b></h3>
<p>Let us face reality, COVID-19 is not the usual flu, and it has been a long time since the last serious pandemic. That is why all the people are feeling stressed, anxious, and some can even get depressed. An employer or HR manager encourages open conversation with your workers. Make sure you ask your workers how they feel.</p>
<p><strong>“It is <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/7-tips-for-working-fsuccessfully-managing-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">believed</a> that the main struggle remote workers face is the feeling of loneliness and isolation”.</strong> For this reason, it would be a great idea to offer an opportunity for an online session with the psychologist. After all, you are working with people, and their emotional and physical being is the main priority.</p>
<h3><b>8. Remind About Data Protection</b></h3>
<p>Ensure that your employees are informed about protecting data. Remind them that it isn’t advisable to transfer work data, materials, and emails to their personal devices without permission. In case they do not have any other choice but to work on their personal laptop or computer, make sure that they <strong>take all the necessary precautions</strong> like antivirus software or not letting the browsers save some work passwords, for instance.</p>
<p>What is more, you should ensure <a href="https://intersog.com/blog/software-teams/how-to-keep-your-remote-software-development-team-safe-and-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secure connections</a> with VPN, as well as adopt smart and secure cloud storage solutions.</p>

<h3><b>9. Trust Your Developers Team</b></h3>
<p>If you want to create a comfortable and efficient working environment, it is not about tracking and monitoring productivity all the time or comparing the performance. <strong>It is about believing in your team</strong>, talking to them, and taking an interest in what bothers them. After all, it does not matter whether you work from home or stay in the office. If a team achieves the required outcome, it means they are doing a great job.</p>
<h3><b>10. Goals Are the Priority, Not Activity</b></h3>
<p>According to Forbes contributor Donal Hatter, who specializes in sales and effective leadership, <strong>it is crucial to focus on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/05/30/top-15-tips-to-effectively-manage-remote-employees/#62a35f47503c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">objectives</a> when working with a remote team.</strong> He believes that productivity boils down to the results having been achieved, rather than what is being done. For this reason, the last tip is to focus on the goals you want to achieve with your team and work towards them no matter the obstacles.</p>
<h1><b>How to Motivate and Manage Remote Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis </b></h1>
<p>Believe it or not, humanity has always been facing this or that crisis. However, the main advantage of the human race is the ability to adapt to any kind of change or environment. That is why getting used to working remotely is also just a matter of time and, in fact, is the future of work.</p>
<p>Embrace such an opportunity to build strong functionality even when your employees are not under control in the office. Be there for them, be consistent, and set clear goals. Use all the abundance of online tools to do work as productive as offline, or even better as <a href="https://www.inc.com/stephen-denny/3-ways-to-inspire-innovation-from-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working remotely</a> today may be the key to innovation tomorrow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this rapidly changing global business and humanity environment — where cost is a true strategic differentiator — Intellectsoft findings provide an inside look at the practices and trends currently shaping the future of enterprises.</p>
<p><b>In brief:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</li>
<li>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results,&#8221; — Gartner.</li>
<li>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses, including collaborative models, dedicated teams, and remote work.</li>
</ol>
<h1>1. A challenging landscape</h1>
<p>As a typical “black swan” event, COVID-19 took the world by complete surprise. This newly identified coronavirus was first seen in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, on December 31, 2019. As we almost enter April 2020, the virus has infected over 700,000 people, led to more than 30,000 deaths, and has spread to more than 200 countries.</p>
<p>The focus of most businesses is now on protecting employees, understanding the risks to their business, and managing the supply chain disruptions caused by the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. The full impact of this epidemic on businesses is still unknown. However, one thing is certain:</p>
<blockquote><p>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</p></blockquote>
<p>Optimizing costs is a perennial, continuous cross-enterprise effort organizations take into consideration now more than ever. <a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/sales-service/documents/trends/driving-cost-optimization-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost optimization</a> is a critical imperative for any functional leader, but its execution and impact reach far beyond the limits of any single functional area.</p>
<p><b>Cost optimization should not be confused with budget reductions. </b>When undertaking budget reductions, functional leaders — be they marketing leads, supply chain managers, business unit directors or technology team leaders — are often asked only to hit budget reduction targets within their own departments. While a more holistic, enterprise wide approach may be beneficial, the ability of functional leaders to impact areas outside their control is often limited.</p>
<p>Organizations should approach cost optimization as an expansive effort that can have both immediate and long-term significance for business performance. To truly serve the enterprise, cost optimization demands a mix of improvements that touch every part of the enterprise.</p>
<h1>2. Under-digitized businesses are hard-hit</h1>
<p>Businesses that are currently struggling for profitability — those with low or unstable cash reserves — are particularly vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/infrastructure-operations-cloud-germany/featured-topics/cost-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner Predicts</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, even businesses that appear to be in good financial shape may not be immune, depending on how the situation progresses. Sectors such as tourism, hospitality, entertainment and air transportation have been particularly hard-hit in the short term.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19345 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg" alt="industries that suffer the most" width="1235" height="596" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-300x145.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1024x494.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-768x371.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-600x290.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-450x217.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1000x483.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>Businesses in consumer goods and retail may also be at higher- than-normal financial risk, especially those in seasonal businesses where demand may be lost (as opposed to shifted), such as such perishable consumer goods and seasonal apparel. Even commodity-oriented industries, such as metals and mining or oil and gas, are exposed as global demand shifts and pricing fluctuates.</p>
<h1>3. Building blocks for change: cost optimization initiatives</h1>
<p>Given the importance of managing cash flows in times like this, companies should immediately develop a <b>plan for cost optimization as part of their overall business risk and </b><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/business-continuity-efforts-in-response-to-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>continuity plans</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<p>In doing so, it is essential to take a full ecosystem perspective, as the approaches you take to manage cash will have implications for not only your business but also for your customers.</p>

<p>Borrowing from the lessons learned from the SARS outbreak in 2003, the 2008 recession and credit crunch, and the last black swan event to significantly impact global economy — the Japanese earthquake of 2011 — we see the following practices and strategies as worth considering today.</p>
<p>Among them: ensuring your own financing remains viable, focusing on the cash-to-cash conversion cycle, thinking like a CFO, revisiting your variable costs and capital investment plans, extending payables, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Shared services, business process outsourcing, </b><a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/eventassets/en/conferences/dci9/documents/gartner-infrastructure-operations-cloud-india-cost-optimization-roadmap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>automation of IT operations</b></a> — all these components offer considerable cost saving opportunities. Enterprise cost optimization priorities — to preserve revenue, continue to innovate and keep the best staff — often conflict with the cost reduction priorities of functional leaders, which are to reduce costs quickly with as little disruption as possible.</p>
<h1>4. Five areas of focus for the enterprise</h1>
<p>While there is a great amount of functional variability in how leaders approach cost optimization, five areas of focus allow leaders in various roles and business units to pursue beneficial optimization (see the figure mentioned below).</p>
<h2>1) Benchmark to get a baseline</h2>
<p>The use of comparative metrics is a key aspect of any effective cost optimization campaign. <b>Benchmarks help leaders analyze their environments to discover what resources and initiatives may require additional funding or optimization.</b></p>
<p>Benchmarks also showcase areas of strategic investment. But care is required, as benchmarks can easily be misused.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19347 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg" alt="cost optimization across enterprise" width="1235" height="957" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1024x793.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-768x595.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-600x465.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-450x349.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1000x775.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<h2>2) Identify critical points in the budget to shield</h2>
<p>To bring more clarity to the optimization decision-making process, companies should identify:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">the potential financial benefit;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business impact;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business risk;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">time requirement of candidate cost optimization projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of impact, the effectiveness of the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Images/infographics/services/gx-deloitte-global-cost-management-infographic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost optimization initiative</a> is partly contingent on whether business unit leaders and their staff are capable of changing and adapting to new approaches and processes.</p>
<p>For example, optimization may involve frontline systems and tool automation as part of their business processes. What does this adaptation mean when leaders consider implementation and training timeframes?</p>
<p>To gain CEO or CFO approval for an initiative, leaders can describe a business case showing how the <b>cost optimization initiative will improve such criteria as:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Business processes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Time-to-market.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The like, as opposed to continuing with the status quo.</li>
</ol>
<p>These criteria points offer a suitable framework for prioritizing which line items are worth preserving, and which projects are worth supporting.</p>
<h2>3) Identify noncritical points to eliminate</h2>
<p>Just as crucial to the decision-making process is the identification of aspects of the business that can be eliminated or reduced. These changes will be primarily quantifiable as reductions in expense, but, again, leaders should consider the significance of each point to the business. An enterprise&#8217;s position within the growth model — growing, mature or declining — serves as an initial driver for identifying and prioritizing cost optimization opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Growing companies have a higher tendency to <b>standardize and simplify IT- enabled capabilities in order to optimize costs</b> and meet business goals for matching service levels to customer demand.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Mature enterprises typically respond to cost optimization goals with investment-based programs. </b>These programs aim to automate or utilize capabilities at lower capacity costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4) Determine cost optimization approach</h2>
<p>Several options exist for optimization, including reduction of costs, reduction of demand, and a balance of short- and long-term initiatives.</p>
<p>Some categories of optimization functions include:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Instituting emergency cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Applying selective cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Preserving costs and business value.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing costs for added business value.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5) Communicate plans to stakeholders and lead the organization through the change</h2>
<p>The leader of a cost optimization program will be in constant contact with all business areas. Communication of best practices should always include details of the practice and expected outcomes.</p>
<p>Leaders can also offer a list of alternative options that were considered, along with detailed explanations outlining why the alternative options were not selected.</p>
<h1>5. Accelerating through cost-efficient remote work</h1>
<p>A virtual remote workforce enables organizations to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce costs.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Drive growth and better serve customers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increase business productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Attract top talent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only remote work enables organizations to shift labor costs to lower cost resources, cut travel and expense budgets, and reduce fixed facility costs, but also a virtual workforce gives organizations a greater degree of flexibility to take advantage of lower cost labor regardless of location — and engage workers only when and where the business needs. For example, many workers sourced from outlying areas and offshore locations, such as Eastern Europe have significantly lower wages than similarly qualified resources.</p>
<p>From Google to Ford, companies around the globe are telling staff to work from home in a bid to stem the spread of pandemic. Such remote working at scale is unprecedented and will leave a lasting impression on the way people live and work for many years to come. What companies need in uncertain times is a collaborative mindset and the ability to map and analyze the value created deep within employee networks.</p>
<h1>6. Collaborative models and dedicated teams value</h1>
<p>Although collaboration is one of the most crucial components of modern businesses, most companies still do not know how to get the most out of it. Here are some of the <b>collaborative models tactics we apply here, at Intellectsoft:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The team members from different time zones are not assigned for one micro task.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Stories are organized between each other to ensure “rolling style” execution.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">All developers work shifted hours to ensure the best possible communications.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Work time designed so that all teams have 2 hours of overlap with regular PST work time.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Overlaps are used for daily scrums, any meetings and informal collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19346" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg" alt="distributed teams" width="1235" height="833" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-300x202.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-768x518.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-600x405.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-450x304.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1000x674.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>What companies need in a collaborative age is the ability to map and analyze the value created within employee networks. These networks should focus on both — individual and organizational effectiveness and on the value the interactions between employees and companies are created.</p>
<p>To make these interactions more useful, executives must reorient them toward the revenue and productivity benefits that collaborative models generate, the costs such interactions impose, and opportunities to improve connectivity at the points that create the greatest economic value.</p>
<h3>Dedicated Teams As More Cost-Effective Approach for Under-Digitized Businesses</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/dedicated-development-team-reimagined-and-improved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedicated team model</a> aims to provide a client with the right developers regardless of wherever the developers and the client are, and negotiate a mode of cooperation: nearshore (in close proximity to the client), onshore (on the client’s premises), or offshore (remotely).</p>
<p>Moreover, dedicated teams are known for their flexibility, niche skills, high scaling velocity, and high loyalty. As dedicated teams offer immense flexibility, the client has a lot of space to be efficient with their budget. The key industries that look for dedicated team approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthcare</a> (among them a lot of pharmaceutical companies);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/hospitality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel &amp; hospitality</a>;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/ar-construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19352 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123.png" alt="dedicated teams" width="1033" height="462" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123.png 1033w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-300x134.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-1024x458.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-768x343.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-600x268.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-450x201.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-1000x447.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1033px) 100vw, 1033px" /></p>
<h1>7. Beyond pandemic: risks and security</h1>
<p>For some organizations, survival is the only way of implementing things today. Others are crawling through the fog of uncertainty, guessing what’s next, where should be the next turn, when things get back to normal. The question is, what will new normal look like?</p>
<p>No one can answer this question for sure now. But what we believe we can state is that the new normal is already here. The pandemic has made it harder for companies to maintain risks and so — the security and stability of their operations and even survival mode. But new tactics can help leaders to safeguard their people and organizations.</p>
<p>We, at Intellectsoft, empower companies and their workforces with digital transformation services and approaches to help them survive during these times. Are you and your organization looking for it?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><em>The COVID-19 pandemic sudden outbreak has affected every industry, business, and organization. But the magnitude of the crisis has disturbed the healthcare industry the most. First and foremost, because this is a human tragedy, affecting their health and lives. It is also pushing front line healthcare workers to battle the virus not known before, draining all the possibilities and resources of this industry.</em></p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol>
<li>Considering the current situation with the global health crisis, digital technologies will drastically reshape the care delivery systems in the short and long term.</li>
<li>Although nowadays, the digital transformation in the healthcare industry is on a rather slow path in comparison with tech, financial, manufacture, and other industries. But still, we have a chance to take advantage of some of the innovations.</li>
<li>Digital healthcare solutions enable new trends in the industry. We might see the rise of the trends like mobile healthcare, IoT healthcare, VR healthcare, robotics, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 is moving quickly, and some changes we see even today. Many health systems are turning to virtual care capacities in order to somehow hold the spread of a deadly virus and survive. From now on, digital technologies will drastically reshape the care delivery systems in the short and long term.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the healthcare industry, like any other one, is influenced by digital transformation. It means that different technological tools and solutions are used to enhance the patient experience, service delivery, create new business models, and make communication more efficient. It’s not only about technology but how and for what purpose it can be implemented to help the healthcare field grow and elevate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19367" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming-.png" alt="Digital Transformation in Healthcare The Changes are Coming" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming-.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming--300x118.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming--600x236.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming--450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Digital transformation in healthcare is going to be an exciting step for society as it automation of the processes, better management, diagnosis, and treatment. Although, the process is slower than compared to digital transformation in banking, for instance. There is a chance to learn more from experience in other industries and even accelerate the process in healthcare based on the available results.</p>
<p>The core aim behind digital transformation is to create more customer-centered services, and it will be of great importance in healthcare as the treatment of every patient can become more personalized, thus making it better for the patients.</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Transformation In Healthcare Industry: New Era For The Society </strong></h2>
<p>Healthcare digital transformation could be a great breakthrough for the medical industry. The implementation of the right solutions will bring a lot of advantages, and some diseases could be cured more effectively and much quicker.</p>
<p>Some companies have already started to use technologies for the benefit of the healthcare industry. Here are some of the examples.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Digital Transformation In Healthcare?</strong></h2>
<p>Digital transformation in healthcare is not only about technologies but, to be more precise, it’s rather about the way to use available tools, software, technologies, etc. to get the most from it for the sake of people’s health. Like any other sphere that is influenced by digital transformation, the healthcare industry puts patients at the center. It means that all the efforts will be put into the enhancement of treatment quality, better analysis, and medicine selection to cure a particular disease.</p>
<p>The transformation has a lot of benefits for all the parties involved, as technologies allow us to work more effectively. Now medical centers and huge healthcare enterprises have to rethink their business strategies and build the way to more opportunities that come with transformation. So, what are the top benefits of digitalization in the healthcare field?</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Transformation Examples In Healthcare</strong></h2>
<p>Although nowadays, the digital transformation in the healthcare industry is on a rather slow path in comparison with tech, financial, manufacture, and other industries. But still, we have a chance to take advantage of some of the innovations. For instance, heart rate trackers that are installed on wearables (fitness trackers, smartwatches) provide important data and can prevent heart attacks, provide health recommendations to the users as they are synced with smartphone apps. One of the examples is the Apple smartwatch that sends alerts once someone experiences atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19368" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry-.png" alt="Digital Healthcare Solutions that Enhance Industry" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry-.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry--300x118.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry--600x236.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry--450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Another bright example of the use of digital technologies in medicine is a company BostonGene. The company uses biomedical software to analyze patients’ disease history to help doctors prescribe the right treatment according to the patient&#8217;s genetics to fight cancer more effectively.</p>
<p>Devices and solutions like this are going to make a great impact on the healthcare field in every country, providing more efficient treatment, better process organization, and reducing costs.</p>
<h2><strong>Top Benefits Of Digital Transformation In Healthcare</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Better Services for Patients<br />
</strong>Healthcare, like any other industry that steps on the path to digital transformation, is patient(customer)-centred. The implementation of numerous technologies will give a chance to make treatment more personalized (as we can see from the examples mentioned above). The individual approach is always better than following common recommendations that might not work in some cases.</li>
<li><strong>Better Analysis<br />
</strong>The use of such technologies as AI or ML gives opportunities to analyze data effectively and much quicker than people can do. Also, these technologies minimize mistakes, thus improving staff productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Better Organization<br />
</strong>Thanks to Cloud computing and other digital tools, all the data could be digitalized. It allows quick access to medical records that give doctors a chance to make decisions effectively and provide more profound treatment. In addition to this, wearable devices could alert both patients and doctors in case of emergency in call the ambulance automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Better Time Management<br />
</strong>The implementation of different digital solutions into the healthcare field saves a lot of valuable time. This is how numerous lives could be saved when we have, for instance, a 24/7 connection with medical staff.</li>
<li><strong>Better Environment for Doctors<br />
</strong>The technologies enable access to a large amount of data; they provide better communication and could provide important information for the research. More profound research that doctors could make results in better treatment and leads us to the first benefit in our list, better services for the patients.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Digital Healthcare: Trends, Solutions, And Technologies Used </strong></h2>
<p>Although digital transformation concentrates more on advantages for the patients and medical staff, still technologies and solutions are the tools that enable this process. What are they?</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Healthcare Solutions That Enhance Industry</strong></h2>
<p>Digital healthcare is a rather new field, but thanks to the experience of some developed countries, now we can take advantage of the following solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>make online doctor appointments;</li>
<li>create electronic medical records;</li>
<li>create unified platforms for data exchange;</li>
<li>use chatbots to provide necessary information online (while a patient is checking the website);</li>
<li>use electronic medical cards that contain all patients’ medical records and prescribed medications, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous ways where software solutions can be used in healthcare in order to enhance the national medical industry. The question is when these advantages are going to be used to the full potential?</p>
<h2><strong>The Latest Digital Healthcare Trends</strong></h2>
<p>Digital healthcare solutions enable new trends in the industry. This year we might see the rise of the following trends:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile Healthcare</strong><br />
Use mobile apps that help you keep in touch with a doctor, make appointments, or contact medical centers much quicker, etc.;</li>
<li><strong>IoT Healthcare</strong><br />
Use wearable devices to record data about your health in real-time thus helping doctors to understand the full image of your condition, etc.;</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19369" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/VR-Healthcare-.png" alt="VR Healthcare" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/VR-Healthcare-.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/VR-Healthcare--300x118.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/VR-Healthcare--600x236.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/VR-Healthcare--450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VR Healthcare</strong><br />
Virtual Reality appointments with a doctor are useful when a patient cannot get to the facility. Also, the use of VR consultations could save a lot of time as patients could immediately contact doctors and describe their symptoms, and by the time they get to the hospital, the doctor would come up with the treatment or prepare everything that is required to take care of the patient effectively and quickly. Apart from this, VR could be used for training medical staff and enhance their skills.</li>
<li><strong>Robotics</strong><br />
The use of robots in healthcare can bring a lot of advantages. For instance, they could assist physicians in examining patients, ship medical supplies, assist with rehabilitation, provide help with medical supplies packing. Also, it could be used for the automation of some processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the most common and popular trends nowadays, but we might see new ones as technologies are constantly changing. So, what are the technologies that enable all these trends and solutions in the modern world?</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Healthcare Technology </strong></h2>
<p>So, today digital healthcare technology promotes numerous changes in society and in the healthcare field in particular. These are the most popular technologies that are used to enhance the medical facilities and the industry in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artificial Intelligence (has a great potential for data analysis thus providing better diagnosis);</li>
<li>Augmented Reality (helps with the enhancement of efficiency and cost optimization of surgeries);</li>
<li>Cloud Computing (enables storage and sharing of data across platforms);</li>
<li>Blockchain technology (provides a chance for other doctors to see a patient’s medical history and continue the treatment);</li>
<li>IoT (wearable devices and supporting apps collect real-time data that could help doctors to have the full image of the patient’s state; these data could also be analyzed and provide useful insights for numerous researches).</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Healthcare Industry: What’s Next? </strong></h2>
<p>The eHealthcare field is only taking the first steps into the direction of digital transformation. Some countries outrace others, but still, we cannot call this phenomenon a global one. But thanks to the available digital healthcare technology that is constantly enhancing and upgrading, we might see a new image of healthcare in the upcoming years, more efficient and almost flawless.</p>
<p>Companies and medical facilities should think of the right strategy to use available software solutions to make this world a better place. <strong><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/contacts">Talk to our experts</a> and find out more about the topic and how your business or project can start benefiting from it today!</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The novel 2020 pandemic takes every sphere of human activity into the next level. Financial institutions are forced to move quickly to protect their employees, transform their operations, and serve customers in new, improved ways.</p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol>
<li>The software revolution — which has already disrupted many industries and has made some industries essentially obsolete — is still rapidly transforming the financial services industry.</li>
<li>Digital transformation banking strategy should include relevant technologies that can bring the most value for both the bank and its customers.</li>
<li>The future of digital banking transformation is impressive, and it is predicted to entirely change the image of traditional banks, as well as bring more services to the customers.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19371" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png" alt="The Future Of Digital Transformation in Banking" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-300x118.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-600x236.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, more and more organizations will miss their financial targets because of strategic and operational disruptions and dampened customer demand. It’s also unclear how long COVID-19 will last. But one sure thing is here — this will not be a short-term event with fewer consequences. Industries, such as banking, should prepare for the long haul.</p>
<p>However, the software revolution — which has already disrupted many industries and has made some industries essentially obsolete — is still rapidly transforming the financial services industry. Digital transformation in banking has already started, and now we can see some changes like 24/7 online banking and instant transactions.</p>
<p>Still, the process in this sphere is quite slow. To begin a journey to digital transformation, institutions have to develop a detailed strategy to change their distribution model, revise and enhance value offers, as well as develop end-to-end customer-centered processes that can result in growth and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>There are a number of technologies available nowadays that can help in the process of the digital transformation of the banking field. Good digital transformation banking strategy should include relevant technologies that can bring the most value for both the bank and its customers. Among the trending technology solutions, we can distinguish:</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>AI in banking is represented by chatbots or online assistants that help customers with their issues by providing necessary information or executing different transactions. Apart from this, AI can be used for the purpose of data analysis and security. For instance, identify money laundering by analyzing customer data within several seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchain</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of blockchain in banking can result in a better interface, more accuracy, and secured data and transactions. In addition, blockchain solutions will make transactions and different operations transparent, facilitating collaboration. There will be no need for the intermediation of the third parties, thus bringing up the level of trust from the customers. It can also influence cloud technologies and move to decentralized ones, which will result in higher protection of the data and funds.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Of Things</strong></p>
<p>IoT is helpful with real-time data analysis, thus makes the customer experience more personal, and banks are able to provide individually-tailored offers. What is more, thanks to wearables, customers can easily and seamlessly make contactless payments. Apart from this, IoT is helpful with risk management and access to platforms; the authentication process can be supported by biometric sensors that make access more secure and protected.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></p>
<p>Cloud computing is another technology that can help banks become more efficient and gives them a chance to provide more innovations, as well as have better productivity, improve operations, and instantaneously deliver products and services. Cloud computing, as well as IoT, can help with risk management and create a secure environment for the customers and internal bank systems.</p>
<p>All in all, the digital transformation of the banking field will bring great innovations that will change the image of banks we know nowadays. Technologies bring numerous opportunities both for banks and their customers by securing personal data, increasing transparency, and giving a chance to manage funds anytime and anywhere.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation In Investment Banking</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19372" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking.png" alt="Digital Transformation in Investment Banking" width="660" height="310" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-300x141.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-600x282.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-450x211.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Despite all the benefits brought by digital transformation in banking, investment banking is going to face some challenges in the current environment. Investment banking doesn’t take deposits and functions as a facilitator between buyers and sellers and keeps data protected.</p>
<p>As we have already discussed, the rise of digital solutions in banking can result in increased data transparency, elimination of intermediates in the process, and alternative methods to access financial and intellectual data. All this can result in lower pricing on the operations and make transactions easier and faster. Investment banks can be replaced by a group of small investors brought together at one digital platform. The occurrence of new players in the niche (for instance, fintech companies), eliminating entry barriers, and disintermediation can put investment banks in dire straits.</p>
<p>Still, it’s not all doomed, as there always will be a need for professional advice on complex operations and big deals. In order to survive in this competing world, the investment banks should think of the ways to use available data and skills in the digitalized world.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation In Retail Banking</h2>
<p>Retail banks have more opportunities in comparison with investment banks, but still, the journey to digital transformation is rather long and requires a lot of resources. First of all, in order to succeed, their strategy should be customer-centered. Banks possess a lot of important data that can be used as a background for new innovative solutions and services that can satisfy customers to the full.</p>
<p>Technologies like blockchain and AI (Artificial Intelligence) can be of great advantage if the bank wants to survive competition with fintech companies, online banks, and non-financial platforms that provide exact services to their customers and have more advantages over traditional banks. These tools can automate numerous manual operations, thus enhance customer satisfaction. Also, AI and IoT can be used together to collect and analyze personal data of the customers for the banks to create more personalized offers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19373" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking.png" alt="Digital Transformation in Retail Banking" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-300x118.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-600x236.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for retail banks in this situation can be to find a professional team or create an inner IT department. But thanks to the available platforms and outsource companies, this issue can be easily overcome.</p>
<h2>Advantages And Disadvantages Of Digital Transformation In Banking</h2>
<p>Digital transformation of the banking institutions brings a lot of new opportunities for the customers, individual ones, small companies, and huge corporations, as well as banks themselves. Clever strategy and constant improvements can result in a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convenience<br />
</strong>Personal and company bank accounts are available at any device, the only things you need are an Internet connection and a few taps on the screen. This brings more customer satisfaction as they are able to constantly keep on track of their account balance and manage the information on their personal profile (add new mailing address, e-mails, telephone numbers, etc.). In addition to this, there is no need to go to the bank to get checks as they can be instantly sent to your email address.</li>
<li><strong>24/7 Service<br />
</strong>Online banking services are available 24/7 all year round, even at the weekends. There is no need to stay in lines and wait for the bank to open in order to conduct certain operations. It’s a huge advantage that comes with digital solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Time-Saving<br />
</strong>Another advantage, you save a lot of time as you have access to the account from home. It is extremely convenient as previously you could waste an hour or two at the bank to make simple operations, and now it is done seamlessly from home or any other place where there is an Internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Transfers<br />
</strong>Direct banks can provide unlimited automated transfers (accept payroll deposits or provide automatic bill payment) with no additional fees for the services even to outside financial institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Management<br />
</strong>Online accounts can be easily managed, although they require more information than traditional banks. Customers can add information themselves or directly contact online assistants to provide support on the current issue. What is more, payee information is retained within the system, there is no need to re-enter data for the following payments, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19374" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png" alt="Advantages and Disadvantages of Digital Transformation in Banking" width="660" height="340" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-300x155.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-600x309.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-450x232.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Although the advantages are impressive, and they facilitate the work to a great extent, there are still some disadvantages that follow the process. Here are the main ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Issues<br />
</strong>Cybersecurity is one of the most important issues that companies and institutions are struggling to overcome. Even sophisticated software that protects tentative data cannot completely protect accounts from scammers, phishing, hacker attacks, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Services<br />
</strong>Nowadays, not all banks can offer a wide range of online services. Still, there are some that require your presence at the traditional banks.</li>
<li><strong>Transactions<br />
</strong>Complex transactions may also require the presence at the bank office. Also, international transactions are not possible with all digital banks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of disadvantages is rather low, and it’s only a matter of time for them to disappear. Advantages take over disadvantages and make daily operations much easier, reduce costs, save customer’s time, and manage to provide services efficiently.</p>
<h2>Challenges Of Digital Transformation In Banking</h2>
<p>The future of digital banking transformation is impressive, and it is predicted to entirely change the image of traditional banks, as well as bring more services to the customers. But today banks face certain challenges that are difficult to overcome:</p>
<h3>Competition With Non-Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>Amazon is trying to provide banking opportunities to its customers. Facebook allows users to make transfers directly to other people’s bank accounts, thus leaving banks out of the process. But banks are more regulated institutions, thus more secure. It is important for them to go digital quicker.</p>
<h3>Online Payments</h3>
<p>Not every bank can support online/mobile or contactless payments. The reason for this is that a bank cannot provide another option but physical payment as it doesn’t have a secure online platform, resources, and skilled team to make it possible. It gets even harder to compete with available online services like ApplePay and PayPal.</p>
<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p>The system that provides online banking services should be constantly updated and have an efficient security level. Cybersecurity is one of the most important issues nowadays that banks should take into consideration first of all. Again, in order to overcome this challenge, the bank has to set up a detailed strategy, choose appropriate technologies and find a professional team that can easily turn ideas into reality with the latest software and available tools.</p>
<p>The process of digital transformation is rather endless as technologies enhance, the systems should be constantly updated. New technologies will give a chance for new services to appear that again will require constant upgrade and support.</p>
<p>Digital transformation in banking is going to speed up in the upcoming years. Financial institutions should take into account the current state of affairs, work out a profound strategy, and use the right tools in order to succeed in the future.</p>
<p>The transformation journey is not an easy thing and involves a lot of resources, but as a result, the services could be more secured and delivered quicker, and most of all, enhance the level of customer satisfaction. As technologies develop and enhance, the banking industry will also get better and better year by year.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Over the past 20 years, advanced technologies and innovations have changed the way the hospitality industry brings value to travelers around the world. With all the opportunities, digital transformation is reshaping the industry, leaving some players behind, customers’ behavior has shifted with astonishing speed towards new, innovative experiences.</p>
<p>Digital transformation is, no doubt, one of the key drivers of industry growth today. But since the sudden COVID-19 pandemic outbreak hit the “pause button” hard-full stop, the hospitality industry especially is losing its positions day after day.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, consumers always continue to demand improved solutions and unique experiences. The industry is rapidly adopting new technologies to exceed their expectations and digitize the customer journey with one-tap check-ins, digital concierge services, voice-activated devices, chatbots, smart in-room technologies, advanced analytics, virtual-assistant platforms, enhanced direct bookings, and more to come.</p>
<h1>Travel. Transformed.</h1>
<p>Many companies from the hospitality industry are still only entering the new exciting world of digitalization. To create a more seamless guest experience, more hotels automate and streamline the travel processes, developing the advanced tools necessary to capture the full potential of data.</p>
<p>Moreover, considering that millennials are increasingly dominating the travel sector, hospitality companies should be prepared to curate and personalized travel offerings and to make a data-enabled transformation work. This generation of tech-savvy travelers prefers using apps for bookings and getting more personalized interactions. The cultural change, as well as the long-term impact of automation, machine learning, and even robotics, are here to stay.</p>
<p>Intellectsoft’s experts have developed an in-depth overview of digital transformation trends in hospitality and what to expect from hotels of the future presented in this infographics:</p>

<h1>What’s next</h1>
<p>Some things never change. Companies powered by data and advanced technologies will always be driven by people. Hospitality organizations are no different. They have to keep pace and grow into agile, reinvent themselves to become more relevant, and deliver engaging customer experiences.</p>
<p>Leaders have to bring to the fore some fundamental questions about values, cultural changes, privacy, and cybersecurity if they want to keep up with automation and machine learning solutions.</p>
<p>We empower companies and their hospitality workforce with tools like travel AI and chatbots, and data-driven insights to transform into intelligent operations. Are you and your organization ready to shift the mindsets and get the most out of innovations?</p>

Businesses are rapidly assessing fast-changing developments and the implications for their organizations. With crises like COVID-19, the time to act is now.

<h2>1.  Uncertain times: chaos or inevitable opportunism</h2>
<p>Businesses worldwide have been reacting to the recent humanitarian and societal crisis that is forever going down in history as COVID-19. Today, we already witness an incredible power of the pandemic: disrupted workforces, supply chains, worldwide economic activity, and more to come in months. But what is it really: chaos or new opportunities for organizations to become more flexible and improve their business continuity management plans?</p>
<p>The reality is that every crisis or disaster sooner or later has both immediate and long-term implications of how businesses operate and impact society. So, it is with a sense of urgency that organizations should refer to their decades-long <b>IT business continuity plans</b><b> to ensure their operational and strategic resilience and agility.</b></p>
<p>Leaders (and not only them) are making rapid, highly-informed decisions. They should take immediate action to protect and support their workforce and ensure that all business operations continue in order to help business and societal continuities. Here are some of the most crucial components of how to behave today to safeguard the antifragility of your organization.</p>

<p>The transition to remote work during coronavirus and distributed teams is accelerating daily. Tools are getting better. More companies embrace the benefits of their employees not being bound to a specific remote workplace on the scale of cities, countries, and even continents. Current disruptions to the workforce (as a result of remote working) requires workplace elasticity and business processes flexibility.</p>

<h3><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;it business continuity and disaster recovery&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:3700253},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">IT business continuity and disaster recovery</span></h3>
<p>To minimize business disruption and protect employees from consequences of threats, organizations should have not only a profound pandemic plan for business continuity but also be able to emerge from one of the most surreal moments of the recent memory.</p>
<p>Here are the <b>three most essential foundations leaders should pay attention to</b> today:</p>
<p>1. Empowering workforce and building a digital workplace</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>A</b><b>nalyze your current technology capabilities</b>, including a communications plan and support structure. It’s essential to keep leadership and employees aware of current fundamental changes;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Examine your ability to scale out internally.</b> Make sure that digital workplaces enable your people to work remotely through digital collaboration tools;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Start cultivating a digital culture and shifting to the mindset of collaboration.</b> Undoubtedly, your employees will require additional skills around the new way of working. Building the necessary skill set and remote workplace of trust can help employees serve customers better while ensuring business continuity.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Serving your customers’ core needs</p>
<p>Businesses adapt to serve customers through uncertainty. This, of course, means organizations are increasingly thinking out of the box to find creative ways to continue working with clients smoothly.</p>
<p>Highly extendable workplace environments allow organizations <b>to adapt to changing business needs based on global conditions.</b> Moreover, being extremely transparent in communication, operations, and engagements — is key to a successful transition from unpredictability to trusted relationships.</p>
<p>3. Establishing business continuity planning steps</p>
<p>While no systems can perfectly anticipate every contingency, ensuring that all business units are supported, informed, and protected as much as possible, can greatly untie your hands to develop new business processes. This means continuing to work while adapting to the new IT business continuity plan, ways of collaborating, and decision-making. But what is more important — to conduct additional disaster testing scenarios in parallel with operational work.</p>
<h3>Six steps for businesses’ quick reaction</h3>
<p>Today enterprises recognize the need to respond effectively to disruptions caused by factors outside their control. By following these steps for quick workplace adaptation and reaction to risks, companies can highly minimize the disruptions and inefficiencies in their operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Workplace adaptation to disruptions in 2020</b></p>

<h2>3. Distributed Agile Teams: a New Way to Deliver at Scale</h2>
<p>At Intellectsoft, we have worked with distributed teams for many years now. Lowering costs while increasing the pace of business — is no easy task. But it seems to be quite effective and allows for even greater potential benefits if implemented correctly.</p>
<p>Distributed agile teams require more communication and touchpoints. On the other hand, they can bring productivity and speed traditional teams simply cannot. Moreover, communication tools, project management approaches, and planning processes are improving all the time, leaving more space for collaboration and consistency.</p>
<p>Despite being thousands of kilometers apart, every employee interacts with the same board, is able to track the overall progress, and share lessons learned. During turbulent times like today’s one, it is just one of a few reliable ways your company can continually improve the work in a long-term perspective and improve business continuity strategy for the years to come.</p>

<h2>4. Thinking One Step Ahead</h2>
<p>The threats like COVID-19 will fundamentally change the way we work and engage. Leaders should develop a comprehensive BCP and new scenarios for its implementations, paying great attention to those basic steps we describe in this article.</p>
<p>The most important thing to recognize about coronavirus business impact is that operations cannot be considered to be business as usual (BAU) but must become business as survival (BAS).</p>
<p>To achieve the necessary resilience, leadership and С-level should clearly identify what businesses and operational processes in the organization are crucial to operating the core functions, and what — are not.</p>
<p>As the situation keeps developing, we will update our materials, so please check back regularly.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technologies constantly develop and enhance, thus influencing other fields of human activity, including business, marketing, healthcare, education, etc. More and more enterprises start working on strategies and ways to begin enterprise digital transformation. Some of the enterprises have already started the implementation of digital technologies in order to keep on the top positions in the field.</p>
<p>The latest business, technological, and marketing trends make it inevitable for enterprises to initiate a digital transformation process. Digital transformation of the enterprise means the implementation of digital solutions into the systems of the company. There is a number of technologies that are already used and change the image of the business world. Among these technologies, there is IoT (Internet of Things), AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality), Cloud Computing, Blockchain. All of them enhance the workflow of the company, its organization, communication, as well as service delivery to the customers.</p>
<p>The digital transformation enterprise process cannot be done overnight. It is time- and resource-consuming, but the results worth it. The implementation of the technologies can bring a lot of advantages for the company, its employees, and customers. Let’s view them in detail.</p>
<h2>Enterprise Digital Transformation: The Advantages</h2>
<p>Reorganization of the processes internally and externally due to the digital enterprise transformation will have certain benefits for the companies that come along with the changes. We are going to highlight the top 5 advantages of the digital transformation for enterprises.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enterprise EfficiencyThe automation of the processes because of digital transformation will lead to the greater overall efficiency of the enterprise. The technologies like AI and ML can process data quickly, provide better insights, thus giving a possibility for the company to deliver more efficient services to the customers.</li>
<li>Better ProductivityThe implementation of smart technological solutions that sustain the digital transformation of the enterprises leads to better productivity. The solutions will help you automate certain processes within the company by minimizing the manual work, cut costs, facilitate the work of the employees, and enhance service delivery. For instance, less manual work will result in fewer mistakes, which leads to better services from the company.</li>
<li>Employee EmpowermentWhen the company starts its digital transformation process, it is important to keep everyone in the loop and spend time on training of the employees. It is necessary for everyone to know about the changes within the system and be able to conduct the work in the proper way. Improvement of the set of skills of your employees will motivate them to work better, give them a chance to show their creativity and share their innovative ideas. By educating the staff, the company, first of all, adds value to its services, thus offers better facilities and increases client satisfaction.</li>
<li>Enhanced Customer ExperienceThe above-listed advantages result in better customer satisfaction and high-quality experience. The better services you provide, the bigger the number of clients will return to use your services on a regular basis. Transparent transactions and quick delivery of the services is what clients expect from the enterprises. The proper usage of technological solutions for your benefit will help you attract more clients to the services you offer.</li>
<li>Increased RevenueAs a result, digital transformation will help you increase revenue. It’s possible thanks to the reduction of the costs spent on the maintenance of the business, automation of the processes, and better customer experience. The more hearts you win with your services, the more people will choose you over other companies.</li>
</ol>
<p>These benefits are the top ones, but its number is bigger, and we also can highlight higher security regarding both the company and its clients. Among them are better resource management; digital culture encouragement; possibility to create digital products/services; more efficient data analysis, etc.</p>
<p>Enterprises that thrive to get all these benefits from the digital transformation should create a detailed enterprise digital transformation strategy.</p>
<h2>Enterprise Digital Strategy for Your Business</h2>
<p>A strategy is an essential part of every process. If there is no solid strategy approved by all the parties involved or it is not shared with all the departments of the enterprise, consider you already failed in digital enterprise transformation.</p>
<p>A strategy is a detailed plan on the process of achievement of the long-term goals. It is a document that will highlight all the steps of the process, their possible outcomes, and expected results. Also, it is important that enterprise digital strategy is developed by the board of the enterprise leaders and includes all the departments.</p>
<p>A successful strategy consists of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea: no idea, no changes. If you want to keep the enterprise a leader in the field, survive the competition or maintain a successful reputation, you should come up with the idea that promotes digital transformation processes. Analyze the current state of affairs, the market, your position in it, think of the ways to enhance your business.</li>
<li>Total involvement: once you have a clear and defined idea, it’s time to share it with the board and make every department involved in the process. Listen to their ideas, take them into consideration, and together work out the most suitable scheme for digital transformation for the enterprise. As a result, everyone should know their role in the process, responsibilities, and work in coherence to achieve desired results.</li>
<li>Technology: choose the relevant technology that will take you on the journey to digital transformation. If there are some doubts or challenges with this part, you can consult with the third party and find ways to enhance the efficiency of the enterprise.</li>
<li>Tests: make sure that your team is aware of the possible risks and is ready to run pilot tests. Every step and its result should be documented in order to minimize risks and move successfully to your goals.</li>
<li>Change: if you are on the digital transformation path, an enterprise should be ready to change every day. The transformation requires constant analysis of the processes and data received in order to enhance services and find new opportunities for the business.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a Digital Enterprise Transformation Roadmap?</h2>
<p>Once the enterprise has an enterprise digital transformation strategy, it’s time to build a roadmap to achieve the expected goals. It is a unique plan that will coordinate the enterprise on its way to digital transformation. Each stage of the transformation process should have a clear roadmap that consists of smaller steps. In its turn, every roadmap consists of the three main stages.</p>
<h3>Stage 1: Defining Value</h3>
<p>The enterprise should analyze its position on the market, involve every department in the process of digitalization and define small, and big goals it wants to achieve. It follows that every goal that leads to the overall enterprise transformation should be divided into smaller steps that add value to the ongoing process.</p>
<h3>Stage 2: Launching and Maintaining</h3>
<p>Once all the resources are collected and accordingly allocated, the enterprise can launch the first project. Then test it, collect data, compare the expected results and the real ones, and maintain new innovations or add changes if required. At the same time, the team involved in the process should constantly upgrade its skills and enhance their knowledge in order to lead the enterprise to the transformation successfully.</p>
<h3>Stage 3: Scaling Up</h3>
<p>When the first projects are launched, and you start to see positive outcomes, it’s time to scale up the process and move further. Upgrade the technologies used, add new features or services, as well as enhance the skills of everyone working for the enterprise. The digital transformation itself means constant change and improvement, so everyone involved in the process should be ready to adapt quickly and effectively in order to reach higher goals.</p>
<p>Overall, the digital transformation enterprise can view as a difficult way that requires a lot of changes and resources, but as we can see, it has a number of benefits. These changes will enhance the work of the employees, deliver better services to the customers, and as a result, bring more revenue for the company. Enterprise leaders should wisely plan a strategy for the organization, describe every step that should be taken, think of the possible outcomes in order to succeed with the transformation process. The path is rather long and requires a lot of time effort, but it is a way to future prosperity and a chance to survive the ongoing competition.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><i>In the era of connected enterprises and total digitalization, finding a balance between optimizing productivity and innovating has never been simpler, yet more difficult, than ever before. </i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial intelligence</a>, machine learning, the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/internet-of-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet of Things</a>, automation, and <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other technologies</a> bring us more and more new types of data. On the one hand, it’s good to have a space for maneuvers. However, on the other hand, many senior executives remain less prepared than they think they are. Navigating the <strong>Fourth Industrial Revolution not only changes the way we think but also impacts how we learn and work using data</strong> to create value from the findings obtained through advanced technologies.</p>
<h2>An amalgam of opportunity and ambiguity</h2>
<p>According to a recent Deloitte Global <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/tr/Documents/manufacturing/Industry4-0_Are-you-ready_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a>, 72% of C-level executives across 19 countries (from the Americas, Asia, and Europe, and came from all major industry sectors) are <strong>ready to adopt and effectively use smart and autonomous technologies</strong> within their organizations.</p>
<p>43% of them consider a lack of internal alignment about which strategies to follow, as the most significant challenge their organizations face as they seek to adopt new technologies and applications. Intellectsoft’s experts have created unique infographics to shed some light on the most vital aspects and challenges the concept of Industry 4.0 owns today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19169" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="804" height="2560" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-scaled.jpg 804w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-94x300.jpg 94w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-322x1024.jpg 322w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-768x2445.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-643x2048.jpg 643w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-600x1910.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-141x450.jpg 141w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-314x1000.jpg 314w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px" /></a></p>

<h2>What’s next? A New Lens of Innovation or Another Revolution</h2>
<p>When it comes to an impact Industry 4.0 will have on organizations and, most importantly, on the workforce, many questions arise. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/tr/Documents/manufacturing/Industry4-0_Are-you-ready_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22% of executives</a> surveyed believe that the new industrial revolution will have a significant effect on their companies. Another question — what kind of effect it will be.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Industry 4.0 is bringing changes to every geography and solution. Yet many executives still do not express the urgency of tackling the challenge of using the full potential of smart technologies to enable digital-physical integration. It is evident that the old way of doing things isn’t enough anymore, but many executives continue to focus on traditional business operations.</p>
