								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this rapidly changing global business and humanity environment — where cost is a true strategic differentiator — Intellectsoft findings provide an inside look at the practices and trends currently shaping the future of enterprises.</p>
<p><b>In brief:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</li>
<li>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results,&#8221; — Gartner.</li>
<li>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses, including collaborative models, dedicated teams, and remote work.</li>
</ol>
<h1>1. A challenging landscape</h1>
<p>As a typical “black swan” event, COVID-19 took the world by complete surprise. This newly identified coronavirus was first seen in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, on December 31, 2019. As we almost enter April 2020, the virus has infected over 700,000 people, led to more than 30,000 deaths, and has spread to more than 200 countries.</p>
<p>The focus of most businesses is now on protecting employees, understanding the risks to their business, and managing the supply chain disruptions caused by the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. The full impact of this epidemic on businesses is still unknown. However, one thing is certain:</p>
<blockquote><p>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</p></blockquote>
<p>Optimizing costs is a perennial, continuous cross-enterprise effort organizations take into consideration now more than ever. <a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/sales-service/documents/trends/driving-cost-optimization-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost optimization</a> is a critical imperative for any functional leader, but its execution and impact reach far beyond the limits of any single functional area.</p>
<p><b>Cost optimization should not be confused with budget reductions. </b>When undertaking budget reductions, functional leaders — be they marketing leads, supply chain managers, business unit directors or technology team leaders — are often asked only to hit budget reduction targets within their own departments. While a more holistic, enterprise wide approach may be beneficial, the ability of functional leaders to impact areas outside their control is often limited.</p>
<p>Organizations should approach cost optimization as an expansive effort that can have both immediate and long-term significance for business performance. To truly serve the enterprise, cost optimization demands a mix of improvements that touch every part of the enterprise.</p>
<h1>2. Under-digitized businesses are hard-hit</h1>
<p>Businesses that are currently struggling for profitability — those with low or unstable cash reserves — are particularly vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/infrastructure-operations-cloud-germany/featured-topics/cost-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner Predicts</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, even businesses that appear to be in good financial shape may not be immune, depending on how the situation progresses. Sectors such as tourism, hospitality, entertainment and air transportation have been particularly hard-hit in the short term.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19345 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg" alt="industries that suffer the most" width="1235" height="596" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-300x145.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1024x494.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-768x371.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-600x290.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-450x217.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1000x483.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>Businesses in consumer goods and retail may also be at higher- than-normal financial risk, especially those in seasonal businesses where demand may be lost (as opposed to shifted), such as such perishable consumer goods and seasonal apparel. Even commodity-oriented industries, such as metals and mining or oil and gas, are exposed as global demand shifts and pricing fluctuates.</p>
<h1>3. Building blocks for change: cost optimization initiatives</h1>
<p>Given the importance of managing cash flows in times like this, companies should immediately develop a <b>plan for cost optimization as part of their overall business risk and </b><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/business-continuity-efforts-in-response-to-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>continuity plans</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<p>In doing so, it is essential to take a full ecosystem perspective, as the approaches you take to manage cash will have implications for not only your business but also for your customers.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19351 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization.jpg" alt="IT cost optimization pic" width="1235" height="887" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-300x215.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1024x735.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-768x552.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-600x431.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-450x323.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1000x718.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>Borrowing from the lessons learned from the SARS outbreak in 2003, the 2008 recession and credit crunch, and the last black swan event to significantly impact global economy — the Japanese earthquake of 2011 — we see the following practices and strategies as worth considering today.</p>
<p>Among them: ensuring your own financing remains viable, focusing on the cash-to-cash conversion cycle, thinking like a CFO, revisiting your variable costs and capital investment plans, extending payables, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Shared services, business process outsourcing, </b><a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/eventassets/en/conferences/dci9/documents/gartner-infrastructure-operations-cloud-india-cost-optimization-roadmap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>automation of IT operations</b></a> — all these components offer considerable cost saving opportunities. Enterprise cost optimization priorities — to preserve revenue, continue to innovate and keep the best staff — often conflict with the cost reduction priorities of functional leaders, which are to reduce costs quickly with as little disruption as possible.</p>
<h1>4. Five areas of focus for the enterprise</h1>
<p>While there is a great amount of functional variability in how leaders approach cost optimization, five areas of focus allow leaders in various roles and business units to pursue beneficial optimization (see the figure mentioned below).</p>
<h2>1) Benchmark to get a baseline</h2>
<p>The use of comparative metrics is a key aspect of any effective cost optimization campaign. <b>Benchmarks help leaders analyze their environments to discover what resources and initiatives may require additional funding or optimization.</b></p>
<p>Benchmarks also showcase areas of strategic investment. But care is required, as benchmarks can easily be misused.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19347 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg" alt="cost optimization across enterprise" width="1235" height="957" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1024x793.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-768x595.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-600x465.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-450x349.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1000x775.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<h2>2) Identify critical points in the budget to shield</h2>
<p>To bring more clarity to the optimization decision-making process, companies should identify:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">the potential financial benefit;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business impact;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business risk;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">time requirement of candidate cost optimization projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of impact, the effectiveness of the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Images/infographics/services/gx-deloitte-global-cost-management-infographic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost optimization initiative</a> is partly contingent on whether business unit leaders and their staff are capable of changing and adapting to new approaches and processes.</p>
<p>For example, optimization may involve frontline systems and tool automation as part of their business processes. What does this adaptation mean when leaders consider implementation and training timeframes?</p>
<p>To gain CEO or CFO approval for an initiative, leaders can describe a business case showing how the <b>cost optimization initiative will improve such criteria as:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Business processes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Time-to-market.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The like, as opposed to continuing with the status quo.</li>
</ol>
<p>These criteria points offer a suitable framework for prioritizing which line items are worth preserving, and which projects are worth supporting.</p>
<h2>3) Identify noncritical points to eliminate</h2>
<p>Just as crucial to the decision-making process is the identification of aspects of the business that can be eliminated or reduced. These changes will be primarily quantifiable as reductions in expense, but, again, leaders should consider the significance of each point to the business. An enterprise&#8217;s position within the growth model — growing, mature or declining — serves as an initial driver for identifying and prioritizing cost optimization opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Growing companies have a higher tendency to <b>standardize and simplify IT- enabled capabilities in order to optimize costs</b> and meet business goals for matching service levels to customer demand.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Mature enterprises typically respond to cost optimization goals with investment-based programs. </b>These programs aim to automate or utilize capabilities at lower capacity costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4) Determine cost optimization approach</h2>
<p>Several options exist for optimization, including reduction of costs, reduction of demand, and a balance of short- and long-term initiatives.</p>
<p>Some categories of optimization functions include:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Instituting emergency cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Applying selective cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Preserving costs and business value.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing costs for added business value.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5) Communicate plans to stakeholders and lead the organization through the change</h2>
<p>The leader of a cost optimization program will be in constant contact with all business areas. Communication of best practices should always include details of the practice and expected outcomes.</p>
<p>Leaders can also offer a list of alternative options that were considered, along with detailed explanations outlining why the alternative options were not selected.</p>
<h1>5. Accelerating through cost-efficient remote work</h1>
<p>A virtual remote workforce enables organizations to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce costs.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Drive growth and better serve customers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increase business productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Attract top talent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only remote work enables organizations to shift labor costs to lower cost resources, cut travel and expense budgets, and reduce fixed facility costs, but also a virtual workforce gives organizations a greater degree of flexibility to take advantage of lower cost labor regardless of location — and engage workers only when and where the business needs. For example, many workers sourced from outlying areas and offshore locations, such as Eastern Europe have significantly lower wages than similarly qualified resources.</p>
<p>From Google to Ford, companies around the globe are telling staff to work from home in a bid to stem the spread of pandemic. Such remote working at scale is unprecedented and will leave a lasting impression on the way people live and work for many years to come. What companies need in uncertain times is a collaborative mindset and the ability to map and analyze the value created deep within employee networks.</p>
<h1>6. Collaborative models and dedicated teams value</h1>
<p>Although collaboration is one of the most crucial components of modern businesses, most companies still do not know how to get the most out of it. Here are some of the <b>collaborative models tactics we apply here, at Intellectsoft:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The team members from different time zones are not assigned for one micro task.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Stories are organized between each other to ensure “rolling style” execution.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">All developers work shifted hours to ensure the best possible communications.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Work time designed so that all teams have 2 hours of overlap with regular PST work time.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Overlaps are used for daily scrums, any meetings and informal collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19346" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg" alt="distributed teams" width="1235" height="833" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-300x202.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-768x518.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-600x405.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-450x304.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1000x674.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>What companies need in a collaborative age is the ability to map and analyze the value created within employee networks. These networks should focus on both — individual and organizational effectiveness and on the value the interactions between employees and companies are created.</p>
<p>To make these interactions more useful, executives must reorient them toward the revenue and productivity benefits that collaborative models generate, the costs such interactions impose, and opportunities to improve connectivity at the points that create the greatest economic value.</p>
<h3>Dedicated Teams As More Cost-Effective Approach for Under-Digitized Businesses</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/dedicated-development-team-reimagined-and-improved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedicated team model</a> aims to provide a client with the right developers regardless of wherever the developers and the client are, and negotiate a mode of cooperation: nearshore (in close proximity to the client), onshore (on the client’s premises), or offshore (remotely).</p>
<p>Moreover, dedicated teams are known for their flexibility, niche skills, high scaling velocity, and high loyalty. As dedicated teams offer immense flexibility, the client has a lot of space to be efficient with their budget. The key industries that look for dedicated team approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthcare</a> (among them a lot of pharmaceutical companies);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/hospitality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel &amp; hospitality</a>;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/ar-construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19352 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123.png" alt="dedicated teams" width="1033" height="462" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123.png 1033w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-300x134.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-1024x458.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-768x343.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-600x268.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-450x201.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-1000x447.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1033px) 100vw, 1033px" /></p>
<h1>7. Beyond pandemic: risks and security</h1>
<p>For some organizations, survival is the only way of implementing things today. Others are crawling through the fog of uncertainty, guessing what’s next, where should be the next turn, when things get back to normal. The question is, what will new normal look like?</p>
<p>No one can answer this question for sure now. But what we believe we can state is that the new normal is already here. The pandemic has made it harder for companies to maintain risks and so — the security and stability of their operations and even survival mode. But new tactics can help leaders to safeguard their people and organizations.</p>
<p>We, at Intellectsoft, empower companies and their workforces with digital transformation services and approaches to help them survive during these times. Are you and your organization looking for it?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">We are executing against one the hardest times of our lives. Businesses are rapidly assessing fast-changing developments and the implications for their organizations. With crises like COVID-19, the time to act is now. The creation of elastic workplaces, efficient BCPs, and distributed workforces might be an answer to uncertain times and can help employees serve customers better while ensuring business continuity.</p>

<h2>1.  Uncertain times: chaos or inevitable opportunism</h2>
<p>Businesses worldwide have been reacting to the recent humanitarian and societal crisis that is forever going down in history as COVID-19. Today, we already witness an incredible power of the pandemic: disrupted workforces, supply chains, worldwide economic activity, and more to come in months. But what is it really: chaos or new opportunities for organizations to become more flexible and improve their business continuity management plans?</p>
<p>The reality is that every crisis or disaster sooner or later has both immediate and long-term implications of how businesses operate and impact society. So, it is with a sense of urgency that organizations should refer to their decades-long <b>IT business continuity plans</b><b> to ensure their operational and strategic resilience and agility.</b></p>
<p>Leaders (and not only them) are making rapid, highly-informed decisions. They should take immediate action to protect and support their workforce and ensure that all business operations continue in order to help business and societal continuities. Here are some of the most crucial components of how to behave today to safeguard the antifragility of your organization.</p>

IT Business <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;it business continuity plan&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:3700253},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">Continuity Plan</span>: Elastic Workplace and Business Flexibility</h2>
<p>The transition to remote work during coronavirus and distributed teams is accelerating daily. Tools are getting better. More companies embrace the benefits of their employees not being bound to a specific remote workplace on the scale of cities, countries, and even continents. Current disruptions to the workforce (as a result of remote working) requires workplace elasticity and business processes flexibility.</p>

<h3><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;it business continuity and disaster recovery&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:3700253},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">IT business continuity and disaster recovery</span></h3>
<p>To minimize business disruption and protect employees from consequences of threats, organizations should have not only a profound pandemic plan for business continuity but also be able to emerge from one of the most surreal moments of the recent memory.</p>
<p>Here are the <b>three most essential foundations leaders should pay attention to</b> today:</p>
<p>1. Empowering workforce and building a digital workplace</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>A</b><b>nalyze your current technology capabilities</b>, including a communications plan and support structure. It’s essential to keep leadership and employees aware of current fundamental changes;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Examine your ability to scale out internally.</b> Make sure that digital workplaces enable your people to work remotely through digital collaboration tools;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Start cultivating a digital culture and shifting to the mindset of collaboration.</b> Undoubtedly, your employees will require additional skills around the new way of working. Building the necessary skill set and remote workplace of trust can help employees serve customers better while ensuring business continuity.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Serving your customers’ core needs</p>
<p>Businesses adapt to serve customers through uncertainty. This, of course, means organizations are increasingly thinking out of the box to find creative ways to continue working with clients smoothly.</p>
<p>Highly extendable workplace environments allow organizations <b>to adapt to changing business needs based on global conditions.</b> Moreover, being extremely transparent in communication, operations, and engagements — is key to a successful transition from unpredictability to trusted relationships.</p>
<p>3. Establishing business continuity planning steps</p>
<p>While no systems can perfectly anticipate every contingency, ensuring that all business units are supported, informed, and protected as much as possible, can greatly untie your hands to develop new business processes. This means continuing to work while adapting to the new IT business continuity plan, ways of collaborating, and decision-making. But what is more important — to conduct additional disaster testing scenarios in parallel with operational work.</p>
<h3>Six steps for businesses’ quick reaction</h3>
<p>Today enterprises recognize the need to respond effectively to disruptions caused by factors outside their control. By following these steps for quick workplace adaptation and reaction to risks, companies can highly minimize the disruptions and inefficiencies in their operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Workplace adaptation to disruptions in 2020</b></p>

<h2>3. Distributed Agile Teams: a New Way to Deliver at Scale</h2>
<p>At Intellectsoft, we have worked with distributed teams for many years now. Lowering costs while increasing the pace of business — is no easy task. But it seems to be quite effective and allows for even greater potential benefits if implemented correctly.</p>
<p>Distributed agile teams require more communication and touchpoints. On the other hand, they can bring productivity and speed traditional teams simply cannot. Moreover, communication tools, project management approaches, and planning processes are improving all the time, leaving more space for collaboration and consistency.</p>
<p>Despite being thousands of kilometers apart, every employee interacts with the same board, is able to track the overall progress, and share lessons learned. During turbulent times like today’s one, it is just one of a few reliable ways your company can continually improve the work in a long-term perspective and improve business continuity strategy for the years to come.</p>

<h2>4. Thinking One Step Ahead</h2>
<p>The threats like COVID-19 will fundamentally change the way we work and engage. Leaders should develop a comprehensive BCP and new scenarios for its implementations, paying great attention to those basic steps we describe in this article.</p>
<p>The most important thing to recognize about coronavirus business impact is that operations cannot be considered to be business as usual (BAU) but must become business as survival (BAS).</p>
<p>To achieve the necessary resilience, leadership and С-level should clearly identify what businesses and operational processes in the organization are crucial to operating the core functions, and what — are not.</p>
<p>As the situation keeps developing, we will update our materials, so please check back regularly.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technologies constantly develop and enhance, thus influencing other fields of human activity, including business, marketing, healthcare, education, etc. More and more enterprises start working on strategies and ways to begin enterprise digital transformation. Some of the enterprises have already started the implementation of digital technologies in order to keep on the top positions in the field.</p>
<p>The latest business, technological, and marketing trends make it inevitable for enterprises to initiate a digital transformation process. Digital transformation of the enterprise means the implementation of digital solutions into the systems of the company. There is a number of technologies that are already used and change the image of the business world. Among these technologies, there is IoT (Internet of Things), AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality), Cloud Computing, Blockchain. All of them enhance the workflow of the company, its organization, communication, as well as service delivery to the customers.</p>
<p>The digital transformation enterprise process cannot be done overnight. It is time- and resource-consuming, but the results worth it. The implementation of the technologies can bring a lot of advantages for the company, its employees, and customers. Let’s view them in detail.</p>
<h2>Enterprise Digital Transformation: The Advantages</h2>
<p>Reorganization of the processes internally and externally due to the digital enterprise transformation will have certain benefits for the companies that come along with the changes. We are going to highlight the top 5 advantages of the digital transformation for enterprises.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enterprise EfficiencyThe automation of the processes because of digital transformation will lead to the greater overall efficiency of the enterprise. The technologies like AI and ML can process data quickly, provide better insights, thus giving a possibility for the company to deliver more efficient services to the customers.</li>
<li>Better ProductivityThe implementation of smart technological solutions that sustain the digital transformation of the enterprises leads to better productivity. The solutions will help you automate certain processes within the company by minimizing the manual work, cut costs, facilitate the work of the employees, and enhance service delivery. For instance, less manual work will result in fewer mistakes, which leads to better services from the company.</li>
<li>Employee EmpowermentWhen the company starts its digital transformation process, it is important to keep everyone in the loop and spend time on training of the employees. It is necessary for everyone to know about the changes within the system and be able to conduct the work in the proper way. Improvement of the set of skills of your employees will motivate them to work better, give them a chance to show their creativity and share their innovative ideas. By educating the staff, the company, first of all, adds value to its services, thus offers better facilities and increases client satisfaction.</li>
<li>Enhanced Customer ExperienceThe above-listed advantages result in better customer satisfaction and high-quality experience. The better services you provide, the bigger the number of clients will return to use your services on a regular basis. Transparent transactions and quick delivery of the services is what clients expect from the enterprises. The proper usage of technological solutions for your benefit will help you attract more clients to the services you offer.</li>
<li>Increased RevenueAs a result, digital transformation will help you increase revenue. It’s possible thanks to the reduction of the costs spent on the maintenance of the business, automation of the processes, and better customer experience. The more hearts you win with your services, the more people will choose you over other companies.</li>
</ol>
<p>These benefits are the top ones, but its number is bigger, and we also can highlight higher security regarding both the company and its clients. Among them are better resource management; digital culture encouragement; possibility to create digital products/services; more efficient data analysis, etc.</p>
<p>Enterprises that thrive to get all these benefits from the digital transformation should create a detailed enterprise digital transformation strategy.</p>
<h2>Enterprise Digital Strategy for Your Business</h2>
<p>A strategy is an essential part of every process. If there is no solid strategy approved by all the parties involved or it is not shared with all the departments of the enterprise, consider you already failed in digital enterprise transformation.</p>
<p>A strategy is a detailed plan on the process of achievement of the long-term goals. It is a document that will highlight all the steps of the process, their possible outcomes, and expected results. Also, it is important that enterprise digital strategy is developed by the board of the enterprise leaders and includes all the departments.</p>
<p>A successful strategy consists of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea: no idea, no changes. If you want to keep the enterprise a leader in the field, survive the competition or maintain a successful reputation, you should come up with the idea that promotes digital transformation processes. Analyze the current state of affairs, the market, your position in it, think of the ways to enhance your business.</li>
<li>Total involvement: once you have a clear and defined idea, it’s time to share it with the board and make every department involved in the process. Listen to their ideas, take them into consideration, and together work out the most suitable scheme for digital transformation for the enterprise. As a result, everyone should know their role in the process, responsibilities, and work in coherence to achieve desired results.</li>
<li>Technology: choose the relevant technology that will take you on the journey to digital transformation. If there are some doubts or challenges with this part, you can consult with the third party and find ways to enhance the efficiency of the enterprise.</li>
<li>Tests: make sure that your team is aware of the possible risks and is ready to run pilot tests. Every step and its result should be documented in order to minimize risks and move successfully to your goals.</li>
<li>Change: if you are on the digital transformation path, an enterprise should be ready to change every day. The transformation requires constant analysis of the processes and data received in order to enhance services and find new opportunities for the business.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a Digital Enterprise Transformation Roadmap?</h2>
<p>Once the enterprise has an enterprise digital transformation strategy, it’s time to build a roadmap to achieve the expected goals. It is a unique plan that will coordinate the enterprise on its way to digital transformation. Each stage of the transformation process should have a clear roadmap that consists of smaller steps. In its turn, every roadmap consists of the three main stages.</p>
<h3>Stage 1: Defining Value</h3>
<p>The enterprise should analyze its position on the market, involve every department in the process of digitalization and define small, and big goals it wants to achieve. It follows that every goal that leads to the overall enterprise transformation should be divided into smaller steps that add value to the ongoing process.</p>
<h3>Stage 2: Launching and Maintaining</h3>
<p>Once all the resources are collected and accordingly allocated, the enterprise can launch the first project. Then test it, collect data, compare the expected results and the real ones, and maintain new innovations or add changes if required. At the same time, the team involved in the process should constantly upgrade its skills and enhance their knowledge in order to lead the enterprise to the transformation successfully.</p>
<h3>Stage 3: Scaling Up</h3>
<p>When the first projects are launched, and you start to see positive outcomes, it’s time to scale up the process and move further. Upgrade the technologies used, add new features or services, as well as enhance the skills of everyone working for the enterprise. The digital transformation itself means constant change and improvement, so everyone involved in the process should be ready to adapt quickly and effectively in order to reach higher goals.</p>
<p>Overall, the digital transformation enterprise can view as a difficult way that requires a lot of changes and resources, but as we can see, it has a number of benefits. These changes will enhance the work of the employees, deliver better services to the customers, and as a result, bring more revenue for the company. Enterprise leaders should wisely plan a strategy for the organization, describe every step that should be taken, think of the possible outcomes in order to succeed with the transformation process. The path is rather long and requires a lot of time effort, but it is a way to future prosperity and a chance to survive the ongoing competition.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><i>In the era of connected enterprises and total digitalization, finding a balance between optimizing productivity and innovating has never been simpler, yet more difficult, than ever before. </i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial intelligence</a>, machine learning, the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/internet-of-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet of Things</a>, automation, and <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other technologies</a> bring us more and more new types of data. On the one hand, it’s good to have a space for maneuvers. However, on the other hand, many senior executives remain less prepared than they think they are. Navigating the <strong>Fourth Industrial Revolution not only changes the way we think but also impacts how we learn and work using data</strong> to create value from the findings obtained through advanced technologies.</p>
<h2>An amalgam of opportunity and ambiguity</h2>
<p>According to a recent Deloitte Global <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/tr/Documents/manufacturing/Industry4-0_Are-you-ready_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a>, 72% of C-level executives across 19 countries (from the Americas, Asia, and Europe, and came from all major industry sectors) are <strong>ready to adopt and effectively use smart and autonomous technologies</strong> within their organizations.</p>
<p>43% of them consider a lack of internal alignment about which strategies to follow, as the most significant challenge their organizations face as they seek to adopt new technologies and applications. Intellectsoft’s experts have created unique infographics to shed some light on the most vital aspects and challenges the concept of Industry 4.0 owns today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19169" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="804" height="2560" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-scaled.jpg 804w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-94x300.jpg 94w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-322x1024.jpg 322w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-768x2445.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-643x2048.jpg 643w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-600x1910.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-141x450.jpg 141w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/info_page-0001-1-314x1000.jpg 314w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px" /></a></p>

<h2>What’s next? A New Lens of Innovation or Another Revolution</h2>
<p>When it comes to an impact Industry 4.0 will have on organizations and, most importantly, on the workforce, many questions arise. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/tr/Documents/manufacturing/Industry4-0_Are-you-ready_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22% of executives</a> surveyed believe that the new industrial revolution will have a significant effect on their companies. Another question — what kind of effect it will be.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Industry 4.0 is bringing changes to every geography and solution. Yet many executives still do not express the urgency of tackling the challenge of using the full potential of smart technologies to enable digital-physical integration. It is evident that the old way of doing things isn’t enough anymore, but many executives continue to focus on traditional business operations.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft has become a highest-rated B2B services provider in Eastern Europe, according to a recent report from the leading Washington-based B2B ratings and reviews platform Clutch. More specifically, we acquired top spots in the highly competitive markets of </span><a href="https://clutch.co/press-releases/ukraine%E2%80%99s-highest-rated-business-service-providers-revealed-new-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://clutch.co/press-releases/highest-rated-b2b-firms-belarus-estonia-latvia-lithuania-russia-named-new-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belarus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The report has analyzed over 900 B2B companies from across different industries: Advertising &amp; Marketing, Creative &amp; Design, Development, IT, and Business Support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine and Belarus continue to gain more and more weight as destinations for B2B services among leading companies around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine has more than 1,000 IT companies working on its territory, which homes a vast talent pool of over 230,000 IT professionals. The country’s software development sector grows at an average of 17% yearly. Plus, 100 R&amp;D subsidiaries of renowned global companies are located in Ukraine, including Microsoft, Samsung, Apple, and many more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belarus homes over 1,000 IT companies providing high quality software and technology services. Its vast tech talent pool continues to expand, as about 4,000 new software engineers graduate from the country’s recognized educational establishments every year. Belarus’s IT services market grows at an annual pace of around 10%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT services markets of both countries are projected to continue their growth in 2020 and beyond, according to regional reports. The countries would also continue strengthening and expanding their tech talent pools, while remaining cost-efficient as compared to other regions. Among other things, this means that Ukraine and Belarus will try to rival the likes of top outsourcing services providers like China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft is proud to contribute to the growing recognition and technical savvy of both countries’ IT services markets, following the tech trend </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/tech-trends-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 2019 we made roughly a year ago. Only this year, we have helped create a top IoT product recognized by </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-adero-created-a-stellar-product/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, performed a full-fledged digital transformation for a luxury Chinese hospitality operator, and developed a complex AR demo for a leading construction company in Europe, among other projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we started our operation over 11 years ago, Intellectsoft continues to be a reliable long-term partner for top companies from different industries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our efforts are regularly recognized by Clutch and similar platforms as well as top publications, including Inc. 5000. This year, me moved closely to the publication’s much-coveted </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/intellectsoft-moves-closer-to-inc-500-club/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inc. 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cohort, and Clutch named us a Top Software &amp; Technology Services Provider in California, Top Emerging Technology Services Provider, and a Global Software Development Leader. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft has become a Top App Developer in Enterprise and Retail categories, according to a recent report from the leading Washington-based B2B ratings and reviews platform Clutch. The report highlights top 247 mobile and web development companies in 14 industries: automotive, enterprise services, dental, ecommerce, financial services, education, retail, hospitality, legal, real estate, media, non-profit, ecommerce, and healthcare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Clutch is proud to recognize the firms that truly take the time to understand their clients’ specific market,” said Clutch Business Analyst Dustin Sammons. “High-quality development or design skills are not enough. The best agencies take those top-notch skills and translate them into products that match their clients exact needs and industries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 11 years of operation, Intellectsoft has gained a reputation of a reliable long-term partner in mobile app development, specifically in long-term Enterprise and Retail projects. We have created mobile applications for </span><b>EY</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Jaguar</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Eurostar</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Guinness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a top American retail giant, and many more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our comprehensive mobile app development services resulted in products that solve specific challenges in our client’s operations, helping them to grow revenue, empower employees with meaningful digital tools, deliver better experiences to customers, and strengthen the brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our efforts are regularly recognized by Clutch and similar platforms as well as industry’s top publications. We have recently moved closer to the </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/intellectsoft-moves-closer-to-inc-500-club/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inc. 500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cohort, and the product we helped bring to life was recognized by </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/intellectsoft-partner-adero-ranked-among-worlds-most-innovative-companies/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside the products from Apple, Google, IBM, and other tech giants. In 2019, Clutch named us a Top Software &amp; Technology Services Provider in California, Top Emerging Technology Services Provider, and a Global Software Development Leader. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing popularity of smartphones over recent years has changed how people read news and articles forever. In a change-or-die situation, media companies needed to adapt fast, creating comprehensive digital strategies. As smartphones became the cornerstone of our everyday lives, mobile apps needed to be at the center of those strategies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, many news apps showcase that a life without print editions and newstands (or only a small number of them), which might come sooner than later, may not be something readers and media companies should be concerned about. If they are properly made, news apps not only carry over the look and feel of newspapers and magazines to mobile, they also give the media new ways and angles to provide coverage, in one place and to a global reader base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five hand-picked news apps that deliver on that promise today. Use our list to get inspired for your own news app, find yourself a new news sources, or simply explore examples of all-around great mobile products. </span></p>
<h2><strong>The New York Times (iOS)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you prefer paper editions of newspapers over news apps, it is hard to deny that the New York Times did a great job of carrying over their long-established aesthetic and reporting to mobile. It is just that: the same New York Times, only more visually appealing and handy and available anywhere you want to read it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user experience and design are outstanding: sections are well-organized (with quick access to Saved for Later and Recently Viewed), navigation is quick and simple, and the app’s clean visuals are really easy on the eye. Whether you want to quickly read the morning briefing or enjoy evening articles from the newspaper’s many sections, you will have a pleasant experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything’s good under the hood as well: there are no crashes and bugs, and the pages load quite quickly even with poor internet connection. The app has ads, but they are non-intrusive and fit into the design organically. </span></p>

<!-- #tablepress-4 from cache -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to sections, the New York Times app has it all: from the standard Opinion, World, Business and sport — to sections on health and wellness, entertainment and arts, as well as video and podcasts, among many others. You can also access the day’s paper in the corresponding section. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a well-produced “Immersive” section that is dedicated to AR and VR news content, the NYT doubles down on the notion that mobile and digital technology hold the potential to give new life to the media by giving readers new exciting perspectives and angles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Readers can access a limited number of articles for free every month or subscribe to one of the plans.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Al Jazeera English</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from its appealing and intuitive design, what makes the Al Jazeera app stand out is the emphasis on live news. They are quickly accessible in a video or audio stream and equally comfortable to watch on a smartphone or tablet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al Jazeera understands the needs of modern users better than other media companies: the app has two more video sections alongside the Live broadcast — on-demand programming and documentaries. Other sections feature top stories, latest news, and  opinion pieces. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17250 " src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-606x1024.png" alt="Al Jazeera news app" width="526" height="889" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-606x1024.png 606w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-178x300.png 178w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-600x1013.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-266x450.png 266w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-592x1000.png 592w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231.png 639w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can personalize your feed in the “My Feed” section, which provide quick access to bookmarked topics, saved pages, and programmes. That being said, navigating Al Jazeera English is a breeze. Even on smaller screens, there is a lot of breathing space, and the sections are well-organized in general. </span></p>
<p><b>Sections include</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Arts &amp; Culture, Business &amp; Economy, Environment, Poverty &amp; Development, Human Rights and more, as well as a separate section that covers different regions of the world. Readers can also access archived content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al Jazeera English is free-of-charge. </span></p>
<h2><strong>New Yorker Today</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the New York Times, The New Yorker magazine has managed to go mobile with great success. Capturing the look and feel of the magazine really well, New Yorker Today serves three goals: delivers the latest news, opinion pieces, articles, and writing; provide quick access to the decade-spanning library ot its widely celebrated cartoons; give fast access to the magazine library with the latest and archive issues.</span></p>

<table id="tablepress-3" class="tablepress tablepress-id-3">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<!-- #tablepress-3 from cache -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although its website and magazine app can stand on their own and can be used separately, New Yorker Today seems to be aimed at readers who want to access the most popular parts of the The New Yorker’s digital experience in one place. </span></p>
<p><b>Sections:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latest news and writing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartoon randomizer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital edition of the magazine (differs from the magazine app)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bookmarks and history</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a limited number of free-to-read articles and a range of subscription options available for readers.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Pocket</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as news apps go, Pocket is not a typical media product. At its heart is a simple promise of letting users save articles and web pages for later reading and viewing, but it delivers on it to the fullest. If you read news alongside articles from different publications, but do not want to assault your eyes with the endless stream of headlines of news aggregator apps (or simply find the look and feel of Instapper uninspiring), Pocket will your top choice.</span></p>

<table id="tablepress-5" class="tablepress tablepress-id-5">

<tr class="row-1 odd">

<!-- #tablepress-5 from cache -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket is integrated with all popular browsers on desktop and mobile and with over fifteen thousand apps, making it quick and simple to save articles anywhere you find them. There are many instruments for managing them too. You can always locate the right article quickly with tags and a number of sections — all put together nicely in an extremely comfortable-to-use design. Other features include choosing the background color and highlighting text, listening to any article, and following friends to find out what they are reading.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this comes for free, but you can get extra features like advanced search and fonts with the paid premium version. There is also a section of curated articles from numerous different publications updated everyday as well as a tool to look for them yourself across different categories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket is continuously updated, bug-free, and the user experience is equally satisfying in the web app and native apps (although you cannot listen to articles in the web app). Interestingly, It is in-built into the Firefox browser and is owned by its creators, the Mozilla Corporation. </span></p>
<h2><b>TechCrunch</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shiny look and handy navigation of TechCrunch’s website can be enjoyed in any browser, but you might just opt for the publication’s app instead. It bares the visual style of the website, but provides a more focused, personalised, and ad-free experience. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the latest tech news with the TechCrunch app is easy, fast, and comfortable.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>PALO ALTO,</b> <b>August 15, 2019</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — Intellectsoft has made another big leap in Inc. 5000, one of the most prominent annual ratings of the fastest-growing private companies in the US. In the </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/inc5000/2019/top-private-companies-2019-inc5000.html?cid=hmhero" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently updated list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Intellectsoft showed a 563%</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">annual revenue growth over the last three years, getting closer to to the Inc. 500 club. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For nearly 30 years, the Inc. Magazine list has been capturing the exciting evolution of the fastest-growing companies in North America. Inc’s past honorees have become world-class brands that include Microsoft, LinkedIn, Dell, and Domino’s Pizza. The companies on this year’s list amassed</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">237.7 billion in revenue in 2018, accounting for 1,216,308 jobs over the past three years, and with astounding three-year average growth of 454%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft keeps growing quickly and confidently as well. Last year was especially fruitful for us and our clients. We expanded cooperation with major existing partners in the U.S., Europe, and Asia to new technology areas, and added new clients to our portfolio, including legal, healthcare, real estate, and finance companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our recent accomplishments include an IoT solution for one of the leading luxury hotel chains in Asia that helped it deliver an exceptional experience to their guests, a personal items tracking product for American consumer electronics company Adero, and a transformative solution converging multiple cutting-edge technologies for one of the biggest construction players in Europe&#8217;s Nordic Region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also struck new ambitious partnerships in the fields of artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology in 2018, and continue growing out technology stack to deliver cutting-edge solutions to our clients. </span></p>
