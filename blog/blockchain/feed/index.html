								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Over the past 20 years, advanced technologies and innovations have changed the way the hospitality industry brings value to travelers around the world. With all the opportunities, digital transformation is reshaping the industry, leaving some players behind, customers’ behavior has shifted with astonishing speed towards new, innovative experiences.</p>
<p>Digital transformation is, no doubt, one of the key drivers of industry growth today. But since the sudden COVID-19 pandemic outbreak hit the “pause button” hard-full stop, the hospitality industry especially is losing its positions day after day.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, consumers always continue to demand improved solutions and unique experiences. The industry is rapidly adopting new technologies to exceed their expectations and digitize the customer journey with one-tap check-ins, digital concierge services, voice-activated devices, chatbots, smart in-room technologies, advanced analytics, virtual-assistant platforms, enhanced direct bookings, and more to come.</p>
<h1>Travel. Transformed.</h1>
<p>Many companies from the hospitality industry are still only entering the new exciting world of digitalization. To create a more seamless guest experience, more hotels automate and streamline the travel processes, developing the advanced tools necessary to capture the full potential of data.</p>
<p>Moreover, considering that millennials are increasingly dominating the travel sector, hospitality companies should be prepared to curate and personalized travel offerings and to make a data-enabled transformation work. This generation of tech-savvy travelers prefers using apps for bookings and getting more personalized interactions. The cultural change, as well as the long-term impact of automation, machine learning, and even robotics, are here to stay.</p>
<p>Intellectsoft’s experts have developed an in-depth overview of digital transformation trends in hospitality and what to expect from hotels of the future presented in this infographics:</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>We have conducted numerous meetings with enterprise clients to deliver blockchain projects. Airspace has validated itself as one of the most critical fields for optimization and security enhancement, and we have modeled one of these cases. Now, we share the details with you.</i></p>
<p>In the past, Intellectsoft Blockchain Lab has reviewed <a href="https://blockchain.intellectsoft.net/blog/top-blockchain-trends-2019-concise-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blockchain technology trends</a>. Generally, they fit within the three waves of digitalization when the first to disrupt the industry are startups and SMEs. During the second wave, the enterprise starts to catch up while carefully <a href="https://blockchain.intellectsoft.net/blog/category/rethink-trust-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">observing the market</a> and studying ways to <a href="https://blockchain.intellectsoft.net/blog/blockchain-in-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upgrade its business verticals</a>. Finally, iconic corporations from a traditional and overregulated space with gargantuan infrastructure and decades of history begin to accept the new reality.</p>
<p>There is one case from an old good business that urges for blockchain implementation both in terms of cost savings and military-grade security — it’s aviation. In the future, the growth of this sector will depend on the increasing wealth of emerging economies with new consumers representing an astounding 6 billion people. Whereas the next-generation airline fleet introduces opportunities to optimizing operations, it will also require significant investment in the in-service commercial planes.</p>
<h2>Why AOG matters: Aircraft Market Dynamics</h2>
<p>When an aircraft signals to pilots that something is wrong, there is a delay. The plane is forbidden to take off until the issue is handled and the crew is safe to proceed a voyage. Such cases are commonly referred to as <b>Aircraft on Ground (AOG)</b> situations. It is also when each tick of a clock costs an airline thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The problem may not concern original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or firms responsible for maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) directly since a planned repair is a different case. But the moment an airline realizes a detail replacement is necessary as soon as possible, it is left one-on-one with the issue. Suddenly, its managers are forced to start searching for the exact piece at the current airport or nearby locations. It can be either an entire engine or a little tube in the lower shell of a fuselage.</p>
<p>Even if the crew gets lucky and their colleagues possess a missing piece, the price may triple or quadruple due to numerous brokers being involved. There is an entire secondary market for aircraft components where managers exchange information upon the request:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Whether they have the needed part</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Part ID</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Maintenance history</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Rapid shipping availability</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Cost for the part and service</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the airline loses more when the plane doesn’t operate, it is ready to pay almost any price the seller and a reseller would offer it. Moreover, the process itself is lengthy and costly. It is bizarre and yet true that airlines are eager to follow these bureaucratic procedures and even deliver a single piece using another plane since that still would be cheaper than losing reputation and money from reimbursement.</p>
<p>The problem only gets bigger as Oliver Wyman estimates in-service commercial airline fleet to increase up to over 35,000+ by 2027 from 25,000+ aircrafts today. With aircraft deliveries growing to 20,000 over this period, the retirement of older technology will total 10,000 in six years, resulting in 58% of the new-generation planes. Such a massive technology shift will significantly increase the need for the Used Serviceable Material (USM) market. Increased USM has the potential of reducing material costs for airlines and MROs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18572 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Oliver-Wyman-avia.-ISBL.-Intellectsoft-blockchain.png" alt="How Airlines Can Save Millions with Blockchain: Case-study" width="900" height="539" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Oliver-Wyman-avia.-ISBL.-Intellectsoft-blockchain.png 900w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Oliver-Wyman-avia.-ISBL.-Intellectsoft-blockchain-300x180.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Oliver-Wyman-avia.-ISBL.-Intellectsoft-blockchain-768x460.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Oliver-Wyman-avia.-ISBL.-Intellectsoft-blockchain-600x359.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Oliver-Wyman-avia.-ISBL.-Intellectsoft-blockchain-450x270.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Commercial airline MRO is forecast to grow at a 3.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) by 2027. Thus, the market demand will change from the current $80+ billion to almost $109 billion over the 7-year period. In fact, net fleet growth by region will vary: the major growth is observed in Asia, specifically in China and India. On the other hand, North America is going to lag behind Asia and Europe as the third-largest region.</p>
<h2>An eBay for Airlines on Blockchain</h2>
<p>In the aviation industry various factors matter: the source of the detail, its material type, modification number, the full time of usage and its current state, the history of the detail maintenance since it left a factory and all respective documentation available. Since the novel aircraft technology introduces additional construction materials (such as carbon fiber composites, hybrid fusions, and special coatings), it adds complexity to the MRO market.</p>
<p>New data collection and measurement tools are designed to offer advanced forecast capability. Platforms like Partsbase and E-plane already support this secondary market with a list of millions of inventory items and automated requests for quotations (RFQs). However, the need for properly harnessed maintenance for aviation organizations remains. Service companies must introduce a formalized approach to the necessary level of security that airlines demand and integration with their legacy systems of inventory management.</p>
<p>During a regular SOW meeting with a team of the client company, we presented a Proof-of-Concept for the new generation tracking and procurement system. We responded to the challenge by offering an elegant solution: a blockchain-based marketplace for selected manufacturers and trusted airline partners.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18609 aligncenter" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Aviation-workflow-300x220.jpeg" alt="Aviation workflow" width="700" height="513" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Aviation-workflow-300x220.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Aviation-workflow-768x563.jpeg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Aviation-workflow-600x440.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Aviation-workflow-450x330.jpeg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Aviation-workflow.jpeg 988w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This is a simplified chart for a system workflow</em></p>
<p>As depicted in the chart above, it aggregates data on ownership movement, parts condition and maintenance history, and is securely shared on a <a href="https://blockchain.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-the-consortium-blockchain-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consortium blockchain</a> network. Within such a network, each participant would have a chance to host their own node to enable real-time data security and decentralization. Our “eBay for Airlines” can help take action before a component fails and significantly enhance reliability, cultivate proactive decision-making and reduce costs.</p>
<h2>Aviation Procurement Platform: Closer Look</h2>
<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
<p>Our case with the client to deliver a supply chain platform for a revolutionary aviation needed to cover the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Military-grade security</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Real-world assets tokenization capability</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Transparent parts and ownership history</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Provenance and maintenance tracking</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fast search and purchase process</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this ambitious task, we referred to <a href="https://blockchain.intellectsoft.net/blog/hyperledger-framework-ecosystem-variations-of-the-open-source-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyperledger Family of frameworks</a>, in particular, Hyperledger Fabric in combination with modular platform architecture. It is the most mature enterprise-grade blockchain framework with consortium capabilities.</p>
<p>Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source private network with custom logic, simple permission levels, sophisticated queries and mixed data formats. With its medium speed, dynamic block time and block size, absence of transaction fees and native support by infrastructure providers, we chose it as a great fit for the aircraft management and procurement platform.</p>
<h3>Platform core services</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18574" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ISBL-services-for-aviation.-Intellectsoft-blockchain.png" alt="" width="1013" height="725" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ISBL-services-for-aviation.-Intellectsoft-blockchain.png 1013w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ISBL-services-for-aviation.-Intellectsoft-blockchain-300x215.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ISBL-services-for-aviation.-Intellectsoft-blockchain-768x550.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ISBL-services-for-aviation.-Intellectsoft-blockchain-600x429.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ISBL-services-for-aviation.-Intellectsoft-blockchain-450x322.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ISBL-services-for-aviation.-Intellectsoft-blockchain-1000x716.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px" /></p>
<p>The system needs to include various vital components to guarantee access and accounts control, transaction validation, asset management, private data management, transaction execution. Specifically, a <b>secured API layer</b> with DDoS protection guards the main point of contact with its database and information exchange. <b>Security and accounts services</b> ensure the validity of digital ID and flexibility of settings to oversee account permissions, limitations and overall access.</p>
<p><b>E-commerce core engine</b> handles e-commerce functionality management whereas an <b>asset storage service</b> tracks all assets, transactions and requests keeping their status relevant. <b>KYC service</b> communicates with KYC/KYB providers and stores encrypted user data. <b>Notifications service </b>provides multiple channels for communicating with clients: email and SMS.</p>
<p>Finally, the <b>blockchain asset management layer </b>covers all asset history and transactions and broadcasts information to a <b>secured blockchain network</b>. As a result, the history of all successful transactions is stored permanently on an immutable ledger and serves as a rock-solid proof for airline’s activities: MRO, insurance, and asset management.</p>
<h3>Payment gateways related services</h3>
<p>The irrevocable element of our procurement system is seamless interaction with legacy banking networks such as SEPA, SWIFT, Visa, or PayPal. Notably, the system can be as fast as its slowest chainlink. Therefore, we added a range of options not only for a quick search but also for payment and delivery.</p>
<p>This module covers <b>fiat payments service</b> that acts as an interface to banking service, an <b>international wire transfer service</b>, and localized rates, <b>jurisdiction</b> and limitations details. Perhaps, we will add virtual assets management in the near future. Although, the companies from our case are usually paying with net 60, meaning that even solutions like TransferWise are quite rapid.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the US dollar is currently considered a global reserve currency, especially within aviation. However, the world is changing so quickly that we might witness an emergence of an alternative. As an advantage, our system can introduce ether or bitcoin when necessary.</p>
<h3>Shipping services</h3>
<p>Shipping is the inevitable part of the process, and our system counts on integrations with the biggest shipping providers to bring maximal transparency and automation. This component enables worldwide coverage and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Integrations with DHL, FedEx</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Delivery status tracking</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Specific configurations for different locations and jurisdictions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Concluding the AOG Blockchain Case</h2>
<p>Intellectsoft has been witnessing how the three waves of digitalization penetrated global industries: first startups, then enterprises and traditional companies. Aviation is among the most regulated sectors; simultaneously, it is the one that calls for radical optimization. We introduced one of the solutions that can save airlines millions of dollars while remaining excellent customer service. It simplifies a complex process of searching, querying, paying and shipping MRO parts in the overly formalized market and promises to achieve a competitive edge to those companies that implement blockchain in their business verticals.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other industries are already on the road to digital transformation, the casino business is only approaching its threshold. For now, this is neither good nor bad, as the gambling industry is unique in its own right: while the digital economy continues to bite at real-life experiences across industries, land casinos remain popular and online gambling has simply become a new dimension of the classic casino experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business definitely keeps pace with the times — land casinos seen a fair share of enhancements throughout the years while live-streamed online gambling now resembles the real-life experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the gambling industry has been lagging behind in adoption of technologies that simplify operations, cut costs, and remove roadblocks in the customer experience. Today, many casinos don’t even use accounting software, moving winnings is highly uncomfortable, all the while online and land casinos are disintegrated. As modern users demand a simpler and faster experience, the casino business will have to face all these issues at once sooner or later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From blockchain-based accounting and cash outs in cryptocurrency or tokenized fiat, to enforcing responsible gaming, let&#8217;s explore the ways blockchain helps to solve the biggest casino industry challenges and help it evolve in a meaningful way. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Based Casino Accounting, Cash-In/Cash-Out &amp; Casino Cryptocurrency</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounting is the crux of casino management. Still, many land casinos approach their financial affairs and cash-in/cash-out management in a straightforward and, truth be told, downright obsolete way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is how the cash-in/cash-out process looks in some gaming houses during tournaments:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A player enters the casino using the established Know Your Customer (KYC) method;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verifies their identity at the cashier’s desk to cash in/cash out;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the requested sum exceeds the set limit, the cashier calls the manager;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manager invites the player to their office;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a spreadsheet, the manager checks the player’s balance, approves the transaction, and then adds to or subtracts from the total sum;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manager gives out or accepts the player’s cash. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a first-hand approach may seem reliable when a cash-out of a big sum is in question, but systems like that still lack in flexibility, functionality, and security compared to accounting solutions in other industries. So, six steps in total, two steps of verification, and three employee encounters (count in the casino guard if the house’s KYC includes them) separate the player from their money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some might say: if the system pulled through the times when every business transferred its operations to various software systems and legacy solutions, there must be a reason it still exists, and maybe casino accounting should be left well enough alone?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But let’s look a bit further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a casino chain has properties and hosts tournaments across the world, accounting issues become all the more evident.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a person plays in a chain’s property in a different country, transferring money is complicated, slow, and entails transactional fees. There is no simple way one can move big sums of money. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gambling laws differ from country to country. A player may win a substantial sum in a foreign country, but might not be able to cash out or transfer all of it back to the bank in the home country.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The player does not control their own money like they do in their bank’s app.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money is not liquid. If a player gambles in casinos of one chain, but they are located in different countries, they must make calls to verify the money are in one casino to access it in the other. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The player cannot borrow money, and if a player borrows money from another player, the operation cannot be tracked, as it is in cash.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a big bag of challenges.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Blockchain Helps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One blockchain solution can help casinos tackle all of the issues above. Let’s look at an example. First, the casino’s financial documents are moved to a blockchain ledger, which can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Second, a custom blockchain-based wallet is developed for players. Finally, a custom casino token is created for the house, allowing players to cash in and cash out the winnings to crypto, which can then be exchanged at a certain rate to the currency or crypto of the player’s choice. So, a blockchain casino is also a cryptocurrency casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tying everything up is an access/permission management system based on a KYC database and working on </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/what-are-smart-contracts-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smart contracts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a set of pre-programmed automated actions that are a part of the blockchain. With smart contracts, employees would get a secured, limited and transparent access to the player’s account to enable their transactions throughout the gaming process. If a player borrows from another player, the process is similarly secured, limited, transparent, and can be carried out in a few clicks in a dedicated mobile app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a player wants to cash in or cash out at one of the casinos, they would simply need to scan a QR code and verify the transaction with their fingerprint/face on a tablet or mobile app of a casino employee (which would also be a part of the blockchain casino software). All of this will be managed by smart contracts in a matter of seconds and not require any actions from the users involved. All the transactions and user identities will be saved to the blockchain ledger, shared by all the casinos in the chain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings many benefits to casinos: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain basically unhackable, so the casino gets the highest level of financial security</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast cross-border transactions without fees in the blockchain network </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Players have full ownership of their money, as this information is registered on the blockchain ledger. The data cannot be tampered with in any way</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playable money becomes liquid and easier to manage</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain enables P2P transactions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biometric security (enabled by a mobile app).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Players can be allowed to borrow money from other players. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merging Land &amp; Online Casinos Into a Single Blockchain Casino</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many land-based casinos have extended their business online, but the land and online parts are disintegrated. This is an old norm in the gambling world. So, if a person plays Baccarat in a land-based house of one company and wants to continue playing at home after the visit, there will be no data shared between the online and land casino experiences. The player will have different accounts, balances, track records, loyalty points and bonuses, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The root of the issue is similar to how accounting is managed in the industry — there is no software in the land casino while the software behind the online part is too old. Here, blockchain provides a solution that’s similar to the accounting process, but with a twist. The processes powering up online and land casinos are transferred to a shared blockchain ledger, users access services on mobile devices and desktop, there may be a cryptocurrency or tokenized currency involved, and access management at different points of user experience is managed by smart contracts. All of this comprises a blockchain casino that connects both the physical and digital gambling worlds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what’s the twist?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most casinos, the system behind the online part is too complicated and sensitive to new integrations. Casinos consider only a simple and light integration between online and physical experiences. On top of that, the process is risky: any bug or issue may lead to downtime. No matter how long it takes, any downtime in the gambling industry is extremely expensive to the business.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, online casinos are highly popular, most land casino players heavily use different cryptocurrencies, and casino management themselves acknowledges the need to make the transition and merge both experiences. In a time where businesses try to remove as many hurdles in their customer experiences as possible, merging online and land into seems like a long-delayed move. Like many industries before, the gambling business is just waiting for one major player to make a successful transformation into a blockchain casino, and then follow suit. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enforcing Responsible Gambling on Blockchain</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some jurisdictions, for example Macao, impose daily gambling limits on players to prevent excessive gambling. Still, as online and land are disintegrated, the law works only as a sort of half-measure. One can gamble too much in a land casino, and then simply continue playing online.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enabling gambling on blockchain solves the issue. After land and online casinos are transferred to one blockchain ledger, a casino can enforce this policy across the chain. The data on time players spend in the casino will be saved to a single blockchain, and If a player exceeded one’s limit online, the doors of the land casino will close for them — and vice versa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The doors could close quite literally, as a blockchain casino can be connected to the security system: cameras will recognize those who exceeded their limit and block them access to the entrance. This concept can be extended to a gambling jurisdiction if all of its operators agree to be part of one open blockchain ledger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain gambling can help players limit themselves as well (in some countries, this option is enforced by law). If a player binge-gambled for a certain period of time and spent a lot of money, they can choose to limit themselves for a set term by pressing a single button in the casino’s app. The money will be securely locked by way of smart contracts until the end of the term, according to the law, and inaccessible to no one, including the player. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summing it Up: Blockchain in Casino Industry &amp; Gambling </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain can solve critical challenges of the casino industry in accounting, cash-in/cash-out management, security, regulation, as well as bridge the gap between online and land experiences. Although the risks of replacing obsolete software with blockchain stops casinos from making a step towards meaningful digital transformation, the industry will still need to evolve to become more leaner, more secure, and address the demands of modern customers. The benefits of blockchain technology for gambling are evident, and the industry understands that, so we will definitely see how the blockchain casino concept becomes a reality in the near future. </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ten years have passed since the world has seen the first blockchain. Although a decade is not enough for such a fundamental technology, an entire industry emerged in the years since its inception. Each of those years brought something important to the advent of blockchain, as companies, startups, and individuals test the technology and how its real-life applications.</p>
<p>As 2018 has come to a close, it is time to remember the highlights of the blockchain industry, how it managed to succeed, and where it is going. At first glance, it might seem that 2018 was a bad year for the industry, especially amid the problems on the cryptocurrency market. As always, we at Intellectsoft Blockchain Lab emphasize that the most valuable benefit of Bitcoin was that it brought blockchain to the forefront of the tech world’s conversation and beyond the crypto world.</p>
<p>Indeed, when we look at the advances of blockchain technology, its adoption and existing infrastructure, the picture is entirely different.</p>
<p>Let’s explore it below.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. The World of Public Blockchain</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1.1. ICO Projects</strong></h3>
<p>Fatigue from blockchain overhype could be felt in the public blockchain sector throughout the entire year. Then, there was a calm <i>after</i> the storm on the ICO market: some projects were in development and not yet showing real value, while other were shut down due to undeveloped infrastructure, the current state of the industry, and other factors.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in crypto space of 2017 and early 2018 was over-enthusiastic, with the word “craze” flashing in blockchain-related headlines almost daily. ICO projects raised tens of millions even before what would normally be Series A, slowing down, losing focus and motivation. Shortly, the craze started affecting even the expert teams, pushing them into spending a significant amount of time and money to keep token prices up and satisfy investors.</p>
<h3><strong>1.2 Public Blockchain Networks </strong></h3>
<p>The public blockchain created in 2017 were aimed at <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/violent-delights-lead-to-violent-ends-rebuilding-after-the-crypto-crash">improving performance</a>, which led to chasing vanity metrics like transactions per second and discussions about on-chain governance that seemed to have no end. The solutions we saw in 2018, on the other hand, have put the emphasis back to real developer usability and native use case discovery.</p>
<h3><strong>1.3 Ethereum leads the way&#8230; </strong></h3>
<p>Ethereum has a bright future, and 2018 only supported the fact (<a href="https://blockchain.intellectsoft.net/blog/ethereum-will-only-get-stronger-here-is-why/">see our article dedicated solely to its huge potential</a>). The year has seen the Ethereum community grow by no less than 200 000 developers, while 94 percent of all blockchain projects in 2018 were based on integrated on top of Ethereum.</p>
<h4><strong>&#8230;but has competition</strong></h4>
<p>Still, the Ethereum community will not have a monopoly on blockchain solutions. 2018 has seen a number of alternative blockchain protocols emerge to compete with Ethereum, with potential to evolve into leading platforms. For example, the entire blockchain world followed the launch of <a href="https://www.ccn.com/tag/eos/">EOS</a> — a blockchain protocol that is often branded as “Ethereum Killer.” EOS’s focus on decentralized applications has already helped the protocol gain significant market value and presence in the global market.</p>
<h4><strong>The other side of Ethereum’s success</strong></h4>
<p>The Ethereum community faced a serious problem in 2018: the number of active users had dropped from 719,093 in January to 232,085 in <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/ethereum-reaches-50-million-unique-addresses-but-active-addresses-have-dropped-nearly-70-from-its-peak/">December</a>. Currently, the blockchain community waits for <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/next-gen-buidlers-the-8-teams-working-on-ethereum-2-0">eight teams</a> to release the Serenity update with a new PoS protocol and new scaling potential. For all its achievements in 2018, it became clear that Ethereum needs a substantial upgrade — and the sooner, the better.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Enterprise World</strong></h2>
<p>In 2017, the concept of private blockchain was a mysterious uncharted territory. It seemed that many companies attempted not to leverage the technology, but to spoil or rebuild its concept into something unviable and old-fashioned.</p>
<p>That has changed in 2018. Today, we can clearly see the <b>transforming value</b> of private blockchains and how they fit into the modern enterprise infrastructure, bringing <b>cheaper and faster transactions</b>, secure data sharing worldwide, and a <b>significantly higher level of security</b>.</p>
<h3><strong>Private/Consortium Chains</strong></h3>
<p>In a major shift, businesses have gone from testing private/consortium chains to applying them. While this was expected, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-services/us-fsi-2018-global-blockchain-survey-report.pdf">Deloitte</a> notes another key change: instead of only exploring blockchain as a technology that streamlines or disrupts business processes, companies have started integrating blockchains into their ecosystems.</p>
<p>Embracing private blockchains is more common for highly tech-driven, digital-first enterprises, but the changes indicate that more and more companies accept blockchain as a powerful technologic driver, and with more confidence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the first industries to implement consortium blockchains were the Supply Chain and Finance (solutions with blockchain based payments) — no surprises here.</p>
<h4><strong>2.1. Blockchain as Basis for Digital Transformation</strong></h4>
<p>In my opinion, blockchain drives the second wave of infrastructure upgrade, digitalization, and global collaboration improvement in enterprises. That is, blockchain will be in the driver’s seat of the Digital Transformation of the Enterprise, no less. SMBs have already gone through this phase, and now comes the time for bigger players.</p>
<p>Such full-scale transformations already happened elsewhere and seem inherent to our daily life today. The always accessible, almost lightning-speed internet available right in our pockets or bags is just like blockchain, only for consumers.</p>
<p>There is a low chance of you meeting someone with a bulky Nokia phone from the nineties on a street today, but big airlines, supply chain companies and manufacturers still use mainframes, matrix printers, and Windows 98 on some of their locations.</p>
<p>It was very unlikely they would consider upgrading to anything: the security standards are too high, the scale too big. But 2018 showed clearly that the standards and opportunities of blockchain can meet and even exceed those demands, helping them migrate to new and more secure infrastructures.</p>
<h4><strong>2.2. The Segment is Growing</strong></h4>
<p>All of this is backed up by statistics. Private blockchain segment has grown <b>from </b><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/blockchain-technology-market"><b>20%</b></a><b> in 2017 to </b><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-services/us-fsi-2018-global-blockchain-survey-report.pdf"><b>64%</b></a><b> in 2018. </b>This would not have been possible without well-developed enterprise tools and frameworks. And the Hyperledger foundation and their product set are the favorites here.</p>
<h4><strong>2.3. Hyperledger Becomes an Industry Standard</strong></h4>
<p>The Hyperledger foundation definitely understands the real power and importance of collaboration and decentralization in blockchain space, and that is why they are on top of the competition.</p>
<p>Dedication and constant development are other reasons. In 2018, Hyperledger’s IT has grown significantly and on-boarded many big names, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hyperledger-onboards-12-new-members-including-alibaba-cloud-deutsche-telekom-and-citi">including Alibaba and Citi Group</a>, and the expansion continues. The Hyperledger progressed by new release and adding features to its tool set — as well as helping big enterprises build their first <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/hyperledger">POCs</a>.</p>
<p>We at Intellectsoft Blockchain Lab have used Hyperledger in many efforts this year — choosing Fabric for consortium setups and Sawtooth for supply chain projects.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16057" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/katie-moum-623907-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Top blockchain trends in 2018" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/katie-moum-623907-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/katie-moum-623907-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/katie-moum-623907-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/katie-moum-623907-unsplash-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/katie-moum-623907-unsplash-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/katie-moum-623907-unsplash-1-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h4><strong>2.4. Blockchain in Government</strong></h4>
<p>The technology got a lot of attention from politics around the world as well. Many countries’ attitude turned from suspicious to positively curious and deeply interested in the technology.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has tripled investments into blockchain analysis firms in 2018, which includes institutions like <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/public-records-show-us-government-tripled-investment-in-blockchain-analysis-firms-in-2018">IRS, FBI, and SEC</a>; the state of Ohio started accepting Bitcoin for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ohio-accepting-bitcoin-for-business-tax-payments-2018-11">tax payments</a>; while West Virginia’s Secretary of State reported that blockchain-based voting in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/west-virginia-secretary-of-state-reports-successful-blockchain-voting-in-2018-midterm-elections">2018 Midterm Elections</a> was successful.</p>
<p>Across the world, the Australian government has signed a $740 million deal with IBM to upgrade <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/us-government-grants-800k-for-blockchain-rd/">data security systems</a> with blockchain.</p>
<p>European Union also took a big step forward with the technology. Thirty-one country signed a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/europe-takes-serious-steps-towards-blockchain-adoption">partnership</a> on analysing the potential of blockchain and its applications on national level. This was truly a major move towards large-scale blockchain adoption.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Blockchain is a great opportunity for Europe and Member States to rethink their information systems, to promote user trust and the protection of personal data, to help create new business opportunities and to establish new areas of leadership, benefiting citizens, public services and companies”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Mariya Gabriel, commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society</b></p>
<h4><strong>2.5. Creation of More Consortia</strong></h4>
<p>Each successful blockchain implementation counts in the technology’s mass adoption. Still, big-player consortia are the real engines of this advent. And 2018 saw many serious partnerships emerge worldwide and across industries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/wetrade-blockchain-fintech-trade-finance">We.trade</a>, a blockchain platform that gathers twelve big European banks (including UniCredit, Deutsche Bank, and Nordea), aims at reducing operational friction and simplifying the trading process for participants.</p>
<p>Walmart, Nestle, Dole, Unilever, and four other large retailers have joined forces for a pilot blockchain project that would improve <a href="https://www.growingproduce.com/fruits/blockchain-future-food-safety/">food safety</a> worldwide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/organizations-corporates-test-blockchains-distributed-ledgers/">Logistics giants</a> — UPS, FedEx, BNSF Railway, and Schneider Trucking — are one of two hundred companies in a freshly formed BITA partnership, which explores blockchain applications in freight transportation, to be converged in a single framework.</p>
<p>Another prominent example comes from the automotive industry, where long-standing leaders (Ford, BMW, General Motors, Renault) and parts manufacturers (Bosch, ZF, IBM, Accenture) have formed Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative, or <a href="https://www.datadriveninvestor.com/2018/10/10/the-emergence-of-blockchain-consortia/">MOBI</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts: Blockchain Passed an Important Milestone </strong></h2>
<p>As cryptocurrency craze died down, the real potential of blockchain finally came to the fore in 2018. Enterprises across industries, governments across the world, and the blockchain community have focused on the technology’s far-reaching transformative power in many operations, in saving costs, and in security — while cooperating with each other on POCs, blockchain implementation, and efforts to fasten large-scale adoption. And all of this in only one year. With more and more companies joining forces on real-life applications in many industries, and with more governmental support, it is safe to assume that 2019 will be less about planning blockchain projects and more about bringing them to life — and putting them to use.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the webinar, the speakers entered a </span><b>Q&amp;A session</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the participants, which allowed for exploring the topic further. Here are some questions from the audience with answers from our speakers. </span></p>
<p><b>Is Hyperledger a</b><b> permissioned ledger that has the purpose to replace crud databases?  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most interesting thing about blockchain — it’s more than a typical ledger or database. It is also better to understand blockchain as a next-generation application. The reason is, blockchain serves multiple purposes: it is a database, a business logic, a permissions system, and an infrastructure. So, it won’t replace crud databases, it is a new concept and evolution of application architecture.</span></p>
<p><b>I&#8217;m interested in use of blockchain for facilitating cash payments in refugee communities. Which blockchain system would you recommend?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some existing examples for your case, for example </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610806/inside-the-jordan-refugee-camp-that-runs-on-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a blockchain-based refugee camp in Jordan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But in general, it depends on the requirements and functionality. From what we’ve seen, Ethereum works fine in cases where currency or token economy is required. Still, you can use Fabric if you want a closed permissioned network.</span></p>
<p><b>Which platform do you recommend for financial tokenization?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many good platforms out there that fit: Stellar, Fabric, R3 Corda, maybe even Ethereum would be suitable for your case. But the complexity of the process is not in the tokenization itself, but in the ease of use and the integration in your current processes. That’s actually why we created TokenD — to make it much simpler.</span></p>
<p><b>Pegasys announced a new Enterprise-ready Ethereum сlient — Pantheon. In an article, Pegasys claims that with Pantheon they’ve rebuilt Ethereum from scratch.  If Ethereum was rebuilt from &#8220;scratch,&#8221; is Pegasus really new protocol? Or is it a new version of Ethereum. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for the question. In this case, when they say they’ve rebuilt Ethereum, it’s not about the protocol but about the client application. So what they are doing is similar to Parity, they created a client that is compatible with Ethereum protocol, but in addition to that they have created their own configurations on top for permissions layer, etc. So it means that you can mine it in the main net (one of the Ethereum test nets is running on Parity clients), but also make a custom setup in permissioned environment.</span></p>
<p><b>How the movement of physical assets and the ensuing changes in ownership are corresponding with a digital tokenization system? How the blockchain system knows that physical assets have changed, left the company, if an inventory item was sold? Are there any IoT sensors that communicate with that digital system?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All security measures for physical assets, including sensors, are covered by the custodian. Without those measures, the entire system would fail, compromising the security of the blockchain itself. In a perfect world, a tokenization network should trust and transfer the responsibility for the physical asset to custodians &#8212; with legal binding, of course. </span></p>
<p><b>Which blockchain platform have you used for a tokenization system/product?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our TokenD product is built on customized Stellar blockchain engine. We’ve chosen it because of its solid architecture, performance, multi-asset support, wide range of tools, and comprehensive customization possibilities.</span></p>

<h2><strong>How To Choose Your Partner Among The Best Blockchain Companies?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, our list of top blockchain companies of 2019 is not definitive. Despite its evolution and increasing adoption across industries, blockchain is a relatively young technology. There might be more reliable firms that can be regarded to as the best blockchain companies that didn’t gain traction yet.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding your blockchain partner is similar to finding a reliable partner for any other project: make an initial research, ask as many questions as you need, expect your potential partner to answer abundantly and be curious about your blockchain plans, and ask them to tell about their projects in detail. Your potential partner will consider whether your business needs blockchain at all, too. Look carefully: in an field still full of hype, finding the right partner takes time and effort, more so if you plan that blockchain will be a big gear in your business.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the sea of blockchain events happening every month all over the world, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Expo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Global 2018 was a fresh, uplifting breeze. The event took place on 18-19 of April and gathered blockchain development and consultancy companies, developers, and technology enthusiasts from all over the world to network, discuss the technology, and find partnerships at London’s Olympia. While </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remained a major topic, the expo served as a platform for fruitful discussions and sharing of real-life blockchain technology use cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft took a pivotal part in the expo. It was the first event our recently announced </span><a href="https://blockchain.intellectsoft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took part in, and the first time we shared our massive blockchain project in detail — our Board Director Michael Minkevich delivered the keynote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Kurat, Director of the Lab, answered questions and discussed all things blockchain with the attendees, sharing the expertise from the impactful </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/solutions/blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we delivered over the last two years. Joining him was Tim Kozak, Head of Technology at the Lab, who also delivered a talk about the history of blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the event had many highlights, from extensive blockchain solution showcase from Porsche — to numerous compelling panels that discussed blockchain implementation across industries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read the story of the two-day expo in our post-event coverage.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Day 1 — The History of Blockchain Unfolding Before Us</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though a lot of people consider that blockchain is still in its young years, the progress the technology has made since 2015 is nothing but astonishing. From recounting the history to numerous use cases to panels that were rooted in reality, Day 1 of Blockchain Expo put the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talk aside to show how much has been achieved in the blockchain world.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4881" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Expo-Intro.jpg" alt="blockchain conference" width="711" height="534" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Expo-Intro.jpg 960w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Expo-Intro-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Expo-Intro-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Expo-Intro-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Expo-Intro-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the main aim of the keynote by Tim Kozak, Head of Technology at </span><a href="https://blockchain.intellectsoft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft Blockchain Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His “Witnessing the Evolution of Blockchain” keynote speech brought to attention a number of facts that are easily lost in the overwhelming blockchain hype: bitcoin was only worth $220 in 2015, and that it has been only three years since Ethereum, Hyperledger, R3 consortium, and Lightning Network have seen the light of the digital day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim also stated that the last three years were immensely challenging for blockchain as a technology. First, it has prompted a massive technological shift in a rapidly changing environment. Second, educational info, documentation, tools, and blockchain specialists were scarce. Nevertheless, in less than three years, the world has seen the first </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain technology uses cases</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These were not small scale projects: companies like EY, Maersk, and Comcast have already used the immense </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/big-enterprises-use-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefits of blockchain technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, coming in conjoint usage of smart contract code and IoT in a single, meticulously developed software platform. Terms like “sidechain” will not leave the territory of the blockchain world anytime soon, but other, for example DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology), are becoming increasingly common. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4888" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-1024x768.jpg" alt="blockchain conference 2018" width="667" height="500" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tim-Kozak-Gives-his-Keynote-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim also mentioned that governments and businesses around the world gradually grapple with the first wave of </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/blockchain-government-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He also stated that there are significantly more opportunities for blockchain-related education and talent development today than it was half a year ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the fact that blockchain is quickly going from oddity to basic technology was also emphasised by the blockchain expo itself, with an enormous number of attendees from different countries and industries gathering to network and discuss how the technology will reshape the enterprise, and the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kozak’s keynote was partly based on the book he co-wrote. It covers the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">history of blockchain technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, existing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (including the Estonian blockchain based governmental services), as well as the future of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain solutions for business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/docs/blockchain-technology-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">download it for free</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Tim Kozak (upper row, in the middle) and other leading experts of Intellectsoft Blockchain Lab hold a discussion with the guests of our booth</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Tim Kozak’s talk was preceded by a keynote from Eileen Lowry, Global Program Director, IBM Blockchain Garage. She shared Garage’s first projects early on, establishing that the expo will be more about blockchain’s high potential than confounding hype. Lowry urged to dream big with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain technology solutions,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and use them to change the future; to always consider business value at the start of a blockchain project; and to approach blockchain like a team sport, that is to actively make connections. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Blockchain Expo Provides Concrete Cases</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event continued with an extensive keynote on the food supply chain of the future from Vincent Doumeizel, Vice President Food &amp; Sustainability, Lloyd&#8217;s Register. The keynote made it evident that the promise of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blockchain solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help the humanity face the future challenges in the food industry (population growth, food fraud, and other) as well as address key customer demands — healthy food, fair trade, animal welfare, social responsibility, food security. What is more, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would protect the food system from bioterrorism. Making a solid case, Vincent Doumeizel argued that the current blockchain hype should be followed by the hope that emerging technologies can make the world a better place — citing positive statistics on how significantly the poverty level has dropped in the last two hundred years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the day, Yan Li, CEO, GXS Foundation Ltd, delivered a compelling talk on building data economy ecosystems that give the users full control of their data and its monetization. Such a system relies on three cornerstone components — users, a mobile application (more specifically a decentralized application, or DApp), and a data exchange platform. According to Li, a well-built </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with these underlying elements will allow to address current key challenges: invasion of privacy, no incentive scheme for a data owner to share their data, no copyright protection. Finally, Yan Li shared two </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain development solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from China, one of which is a blockchain city in a decentralized blockchain app, on its own </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another impressive keynote came from Porsche. The legendary vehicle-maker </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-brands-use-augmented-reality-in-manufacturing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been embracing the latest tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decisively and profusely, including blockchain. The company has been developing a blockchain ecosystem with vehicles and user privacy at its heart. Porsche aims to establish a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain solution</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), tokens, and Ethereum-based smart contracts — to elevate the smart car concept to the the highest point possible. Apart from the high level of privacy offered by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Porsche drivers will enjoy easier access to car services, control over their data, and over the car in general. For example, Porsche’s blockchain solution will allow drivers to give access to their trunk, so that a delivery service employee can put the parcel into it; share their car on blockchain with friends, colleagues, and family members; charge the car; and other. Although the project is in early stages, the scale is ambitious; it seems Porsche is concrete about using the potential of blockchain to the fullest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Towards the end of Day 1, there also was a lively discussion on the “Blockchain in the Healthcare System” panel. Moderated by Tina Woods from Collider Health, and with Stewart Southey from NHS, the participants discussed moving patient data within the blockchain, the importance of patient privacy and security in data sharing, as well as automated patient consent. The healthcare industry will be among the first to reap immense </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefits of blockchain technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Nick Kurat (left) answers the questions of our booth&#8217;s guests</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going back to Intellectsoft, our leading experts had been answering questions all day long. Tim Kozak and Nick Kurat, director of the Lab, were busy sharing the experience, answering questions, and holding blockchain discussions with the guests of our booth. Still, the most anticipated event was scheduled for Day 2: Intellectsoft’s Board Director Michael Minkevich would share the details of our massive blockchain project in detail for the first time.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Day 2 — Fruitful Discussions About Blockchain Technologies</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Minkevich’s keynote was dedicated to our ambitious blockchain project — a multi-category ecommerce platform based on digital tokens.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4884" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Case-1024x768.jpg" alt="blockchain development solutions" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Case-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Case-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Case-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Case-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Case-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Case-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael started off with providing a long list of challenges of the traditional ecommerce that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> similar to ours can solve, including high commissions, low customer engagement, security risks, and obscure matching and ranking models. Then, Michael named the fundamentals of our platform that helped provide the solutions to these problems: the decision to use a private blockchain as a backbone; easy access for merchants; ensuring there is no fiat money inside the platform; establishing a platform-wide loyalty program based on digital tokens; white-label solutions for larger merchants and brands; and more.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4886" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Starts-Keynote-1024x768.jpg" alt="blockchain technology solutions" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Starts-Keynote-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Starts-Keynote-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Starts-Keynote-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Starts-Keynote-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Starts-Keynote-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-Starts-Keynote-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this, Michael dived deeper — sharing details about how the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s merchant ecosystem works, its token economy, and the platform architecture, adding the statistics on the steady and consistent growth of customers, merchants, and orders along the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Michael shared the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">history of the blockchain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platform, pinpointing the advantages and challenges of building the two previous versions. A slide about the current version followed, and Michael made the last clicks of the remote, preparing to answer the questions of the visitors of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Expo 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4885" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-is-Giving-his-Keynote-1024x768.jpg" alt="blockchain solutions" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-is-Giving-his-Keynote-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-is-Giving-his-Keynote-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-is-Giving-his-Keynote-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-is-Giving-his-Keynote-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-is-Giving-his-Keynote-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Michael-Minkevich-is-Giving-his-Keynote-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Blockchain Platform as a Foundation for Business</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second day had many memorable moments, coming in exciting and diverse panels whose experts discussed blockchain usage in a number of industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first prominent panel of Day 2 of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Expo 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was “Blockchain for Manufacturing,” which had Neil Marshall, Global Director, Quality &amp; Food Safety at The Coca-Cola Company, among its participants. The experts started off with discussing the general applications of blockchain in manufacturing. They got to details quickly, conversing about how the technology could help in supply chain visibility, anti-counterfeiting, and airworthiness certificate tracking. The experts also brought to attention the higher level of efficiency and better cost optimisation with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain as a platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in general, concluding with thoughts on how the technology will influence the future of the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next panel was dedicated to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain solutions for business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the property market. Experts from Juniper Research and The Bitfury Group set forth how blockchain can be used to follow the entire transaction history of property, and the benefits of the technology in this case. As the panel continued, it quickly became clear that blockchain is the means that will significantly elevate the property industry. This includes immediate transactions with smart contracts from anywhere in the world, reduced fraud risks, more secure digital databases and identifications — the industry could leverage all the tools offered by the technology, in one platform.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4855" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Technology-Regulation-in-the-US.jpg" alt="Blockchain Regulation" width="640" height="512" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Technology-Regulation-in-the-US.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Technology-Regulation-in-the-US-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Technology-Regulation-in-the-US-768x614.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Technology-Regulation-in-the-US-600x480.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Technology-Regulation-in-the-US-450x360.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Day 2 also raised the crucial question of current blockchain regulation. A panel of experts discussed the development of standards for interoperable </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain technology solutions;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whether regulations need to adjust the classification of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and address taxation, money laundering and security; examined the challenges of deploying </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain solutions for business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To briefly sum it up, the majority of countries want to heavily regulate cryptocurrency, but not the blockchain technology. You can also read our extensive summary on the current state of </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/blockchain-government-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain regulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing on the subject of blockchain and finance,  Oliver Volk, Allianz Blockchain Expert and Keynote Speaker at Allianz Re, moderated a panel dedicated to the insurance industry. The experts concluded that blockchain platforms can help drive innovation in insurance business by making it more effective in fraud detection, pricing, and lowering administrative costs; by improving customer engagement and allowing for more cost-efficient offerings on emerging markets; as well as by helping address the many trends of digitalisation in mature markets. The paired power of blockchain and IoT in one platform was also brought to attention of the attendees. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Taking Care of User Experience in Blockchain Solutions</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Expo 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was coming to a close, Chris Tse from Cardstack gave his “Humanizing the Blockchain” keynote, which primary dealt with the importance of UX in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain technology solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dedicating a separate keynote to the subject was essential. With strong hype, the speed with which blockchain technologies evolve, and the increasingly competitive blockchain market, it is important to remember that users come first. Tse argued that, in 2018, the best interfaces still needed improvement — to offer a consistent and cohesive experience, and deliver on the promise of control of digital living. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially important if the blockchain community really sees the technology as a massive force for change that would eventually reach mass adoption. In other words, when the talks about what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies to watch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> come to an end and blockchain becomes part of our daily lives, the developers need to ensure that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain technologies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are almost as easy to use as current online stores, digital payments, or even coffee makers. Tse raised important questions: How can we design solid DApps and deliver on the promise of decentralization in full? What conceptual obstacles in users’ minds developers need to overcome to built such an app? Could we go beyond even the most bold solutions discussed at any </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain technology conference</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Tse’s talk proved to be exciting, gripping, and thought-provoking.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4889" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-1024x768.jpg" alt="blockchain conference" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Expo-is-Ending-min-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Expo 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was coming to a close. The evening speakers made the last clicks on their remotes and prepared to answer the final questions of the event, while attendees were still holding blockchain discussions here and there. In an hour or so, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Expo 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be over, with Olympia hall empty, waiting for the next conference full of daring minds and decisive entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, this year’s attendees of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Expo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> held talks on topics like the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">difference between cryptocurrencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Still, the event has shown that the immense potential of blockchain technology is steadily emerging from the hype as a technological force to positively change the enterprise, and the world.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the current rise of </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/big-enterprises-use-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, governments around the world have already issued the first blockchain-related laws. Should companies approach blockchain with suspicion? Does blockchain government regulation concern solely cryptocurrencies, or the entire range of blockchain solutions? Join </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as we look at the first wave of blockchain laws.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Blockchain Regulation — Always the Long Road</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin has remained in the shadow for several years since its release in 2009, which is a long time for our fast-paced world that quickly embraces new technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos, people met cars, cellphones, and internet with the same level of suspicion as bitcoin and blockchain. Before a revolutionary technology reaches widespread adoption, a lot of people predict its downfall, while governments introduce wide-ranging regulation. Such technologies are perceived as unfitting in the first place, with many branding them too slow or too complex. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, if a technology holds immense potential, the adoption will continue. Blockchain is currently in the middle of this process. Now, let’s look at the adoption timeline of blockchain and how governments around the globe made their first steps in regulating the technology.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Blockchain Technology Regulation — The Timeline</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term “blockchain” was first used in the fall of 2015. In the following year, the craze over this new concept of storing data in a secure and immune way, as well as Bitcoin cryptocurrency it provides the foundation for, spread across the globe with initial coin offerings (ICOs), an issuance of virtual tokens for the primary investment. ICOs gave way to the companies of a new breed: they avoided a traditional venture capital and promised to disrupt every industry with blockchain technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, programmable money was the first application of blockchain, with projects like Monero and Litecoin following the steps of Bitcoin. The immense hype accelerated the growth of cryptocurrencies’ value and increased the number of people investing in them. In 2017 alone new and experienced cryptocurrency investors spent over $6 billion on ICOs, not taking into account billions of dollars invested in purchasing more bitcoin, ethereum, and other decentralized currencies. The popularity of ICOs has also led to the proliferation of illegal financial activities known as “</span><a href="https://bitfalls.com/2018/01/12/anatomy-pump-dump-group/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pump-and-dumps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, China and a few other countries banned ICOs in 2017. Regulatory meetings happened very often, and governments started issuing new laws with similar regularity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has led to creation of </span><a href="http://map.bitlegal.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BitLegal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — an online map that tracks the constantly evolving regulatory landscape of cryptographic assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT), as well as reflects how governments around the world regulate cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s start reviewing blockchain regulation across the world in depth. Concurrently, it is important to understand that, in most cases, only one particular blockchain application captured the attention of lawmakers — blockchain in finance. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Regulation of Cryptocurrency Around the World</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas the global community is seeking consensus on cryptocurrency regulation, the national governments are making their own maneuvers, and it is important to understand the intentions behind them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, small countries like Gibraltar, Bermuda, and Lichtenstein are all seeking to attract new capital and become crypto-friendly as a result. The Republic of Marshall Islands and Venezuela even issue their own tokens to oppose external financial influence.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/03/20/the-nsa-worked-to-track-down-bitcoin-users-snowden-documents-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Edward Snowden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the National Security Agency (NSA) of the US had been extensively tracking Bitcoin users for years. Allegedly, this was carried out to prevent money laundering and counter terrorism financing with ICOs. Meanwhile, the US government has equated this type of fundraising to IPO in the majority of cases. The country also looks into developing procedures and licensing for blockchain-related instruments. As blockchain technology regulation is an ongoing process worldwide, it is more convenient to stay updated with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corresponding resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4854" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Regulation-in-France.jpg" alt="Blockchain Technology Regulation" width="601" height="481" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Regulation-in-France.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Regulation-in-France-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Regulation-in-France-768x614.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Regulation-in-France-600x480.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-Regulation-in-France-450x360.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 20, 2018, G20 countries gathered in Buenos Aires to discuss the possible regulation of cryptocurrency. Argentina, Australia, Turkey, South Africa, and the United Kingdom proclaimed that they decided not to regulate cryptocurrencies. Mark Carney, the head of The Bank of England, was a chairman of G20’s Financial Stability Board and mentioned that “cryptoassets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time,” citing the relatively small capitalization of the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bill-on-digital-assets-filed-in-the-duma-disagreements-resolved/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russia is drafting a bill that will allow the registration of cryptocurrency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exchanges only on official government websites. This June, G20 members will meet again to share “very specific recommendations on not what to regulate but what data they need for this,” as </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/g20-calls-crypto-regulation-recommendations-july/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinDesk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities in Indonesia have ruled out the usage of cryptocurrencies. Indonesia Central Bank insisted that Indonesian rupiah is the only currency permitted for transactions inside the country, referring to the country’s currency act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://cryptovest.com/news/saudi-arabia-weighing-soft-crypto-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saudi Arabia is working on establishing legal norms for blockchain technology implementation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without prohibiting cryptocurrencies. The country cooperated with the UAE on a pilot project to explore cross-border digital currency payments on blockchain. In October 2017, the Saudi Arabian Islamic Development Bank ordered its researchers to develop blockchain-based products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some </span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/italy-completes-consultations-on-registration-of-crypto-companies/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italian banks are considering to issue their own cryptocurrency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while the government wants to determine the number of commercial companies accepting payments in cryptocurrency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">France warns its citizens of risks associated with the new class of digital assets and </span><a href="https://www.ccn.com/frances-finance-minister-plans-ico-regulations-in-bid-to-attract-crypto-startups/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prepares a law on ICOs and cryptocurrencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Korea is against anonymous transactions and currently develops a tax law, whereas Japan and Germany acknowledged bitcoin as an eligible currency and have taxed it, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, India prohibits cryptocurrency payments, considering them illegal. Brazil prohibits investing in bitcoin as well. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Blockchain Government Regulation</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, the regulations are mostly limited to cryptocurrencies and ICOs. While blockchain is still in its infancy, governments around the world recognize the value of distributed ledger technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switzerland has been among the pioneers in the blockchain field. One of its cities — Zug — hosts several blockchain startups and offers a flexible taxation and solid legislative protection to the companies of the blockchain breed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada is another example of how regulators can embrace the technology. Recently, the Canadian government allowed to issue an </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/canada-approves-countrys-first-blockchain-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETF for blockchain technologies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which can now be traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Apart from that, the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada utilizes blockchain technology to better track and publish information about grant funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China might see to be harsh “on the current blockchain hype [which] is focusing on fundraising and speculation,” says Hu Danqing, a technology product specialist from Alibaba, in an </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-state-media-blockchain-needs-regulation-grow/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Still, the country’s officials believe that the blockchain technology can solve real-world problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, the United States, the UK, Singapore and Japan do not intend to scare away the blockchain industry professionals, admitting the need for proper blockchain regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the hearing in the US on February 6, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Jay Clayton and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Christopher Giancarlo spoke before the Senate Banking Committee on the topic of </span><a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=D8EC44B1-F141-4778-A042-584E0F3B9D39" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtual currencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They recognized the numerous ways of blockchain implementation across dozens of industries, from finance to health and to media, and even said that “there could be no blockchain without bitcoin.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.ethnews.com/seven-takeaways-from-the-sec-and-cftcs-testimony-on-virtual-currency" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">EthNews</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> summarized the hearing’s with most important statements. For instance, both commissioners agree there is no systematic risk coming from cryptocurrencies, since their market capitalization remains a small part of the global economy. The officials also admitted they lacked economists in the blockchain field and that blockchain regulation on the state level is still chaotic. Thus, a solution to the current status quo, as well as blockchain implementation in the government sector, are welcomed. Marco Santori of Cooley once emphasized that </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/12/12/how-crypto-and-blockchain-technology-should-be-regulated/#b7533ea67ba9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain and cryptocurrency regulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depends on the applications of the technology.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Blockchain Government Regulation — European Blockchain Partnership</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a standout announcement, 22 European countries have recently signed a Declaration on establishment of a </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/european-countries-join-blockchain-partnership" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Blockchain Partnership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The partnership “will be a vehicle for cooperation amongst Member States to exchange experience and expertise in technical and regulatory fields and prepare for the launch of EU-wide blockchain applications across the Digital Single Market for the benefit of the public and private sectors.” The partnership will also ensure that Europe “continues to play a leading role in the development and roll-out of blockchain technologies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, The European Commission also launched the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum, investing over </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">€</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">80 million in blockchain projects that support the use of blockchain in technical and societal areas, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">€</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">300 million more to be allocated to blockchain implementation by 2020.</span></p>

</span></i></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">List of countries who signed the Declaration includes UK, Norway, Germany, France, Finland, Portugal, Poland, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, welcomed the signature of the Declaration, stating the following: &#8220;In the future, all public services will use blockchain technology. Blockchain is a great opportunity for Europe and Member States to rethink their information systems, to promote user trust and the protection of personal data, to help create new business opportunities and to establish new areas of leadership, benefiting citizens, public services and companies.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion — Future of Blockchain Regulation</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology implementation and regulation poses minimal to no danger to businesses wanting to embrace the technology, while we still have to see what the future holds for the global adoption of cryptocurrencies and ICOs. Furthermore, Western governments encourage blockchain implementation in public services and welcome the usage of technology in the corporate sector. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft has developed a number of <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/solutions/blockchain">blockchain technology</a> solutions</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and we have started an ongoing series of posts about blockchain to provide a deeper understanding of the technology and everything related to it.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the word “blockchain” was mostly associated with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many people gaped at everyday </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> price leaps, even if they did not invest in it. Established media started to write abundantly about initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency farms, and the Ethereum Project. Famous people from the tech and entertainment businesses joined the conversation about Bitcoin and made investments into the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">most promising cryptocurrencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. More and more people found out what </span><a href="http://monero.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is. In one year, decentralized virtual money have travelled a path from a vague tech term to worldwide phenomena. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concurrently, the backbone of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — blockchain — also got more traction, and for a good reason. The technology offers the highest level of security and automation available to date to enterprises in any industry. For example </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/big-enterprises-use-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">J. P. Morgan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has built a blockchain-based mobile payments system, while Maersk and EY have built a marine insurance platform that automates the insurance process with blockchain-based </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/what-are-smart-contracts-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smart contracts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Comcast, Disney, and other big companies across industries have extended the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">list of blockchain platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that bring business value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are transforming the world as we know it. But where did it all start? And, more importantly, what is the next step in blockchain technology adoption?</span></p>
<h2><b>First Generation — </b><b>Cryptocurrencies</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subprime mortgage crisis of 2008 was a devastating event for the world economy. In the book “Cryptoassets,” Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar argue that the lack of a transparency and immutability of complex financial instruments were the reasons the crisis occured in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent a similar event from happening again, an individual (or group of individuals) under the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto have shortly, in 2009, created a decentralized virtual currency called </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The backbone of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — blockchain — has allowed for the seeked level of transparency and immutability, as well as eliminated the middleman (a bank, a government, a financial institution) from the payment process.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4671" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cryptocurrencies.jpg" alt="List of cryptocurrencies" width="646" height="395" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cryptocurrencies.jpg 900w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cryptocurrencies-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cryptocurrencies-768x469.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cryptocurrencies-600x367.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cryptocurrencies-450x275.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serving as a new payment medium was the only purpose of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time. The publicly verifiable virtual money gradually gained popularity among IT enthusiasts and the Dark Web users. Soon, the media began to refer to Bitcoin as  “the first cryptocurrency.” As </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continued to gain traction worldwide, new </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started to emerge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, the IT enthusiasts helped to engage a broader audience with cryptographic money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefits of cryptocurrencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> began and ended on providing a secure payment method fit for the tech-savvy times and the demands of modern users, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">list of cryptocurrencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been growing steadily. People chose to mine and invest in new decentralized money that mimicked </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other chose alternatives like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monero</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides a higher level of anonymity than other platforms.</span></p>
<h2><b>Second Generation — </b><b>Blockchain Platforms</b><b> with Smart Contracts</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The success of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brought together IT intellectuals to review the potential of the distributed ledger technology (DLT). Vitalik Buterin proposed a wider use of blockchain — smart contracts. Computer code on blockchain that automatically executes and enforces a set of actions and involves </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like tokens, the concept of a smart contract became the basis for Buterin’s blockchain platform name Ethereum. If </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a monetary revolution, Ethereum revolutionized and decentralized the Internet, resulting in the rise of decentralized apps (DApps), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and the development of new platforms with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain smart contracts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4672" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Contracts-1.jpg" alt="blockchain smart contracts" width="646" height="395" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Contracts-1.jpg 900w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Contracts-1-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Contracts-1-768x469.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Contracts-1-600x367.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Smart-Contracts-1-450x275.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, developers across the world soon joined the new technological revolution, using Ethereum to launch their own tokens and raise money from the public with initial coin offerings, which provided an alternative means to raise venture capital. NEO, NEM and other </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined the cohort of the new wave of second-generation blockchains, letting developers create new projects on top of them, as well as launch blockchain-based businesses and organize decentralized governance.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Third Generation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — </span><b>Scalable, Interoperable Ecosystems</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third blockchain generation is currently in its infancy. Projects that aspire to meet the requirements of this category invision global applications of everything blockchain technology has to offer. These will be enormous </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that automate organizational structures like cities, every organizational body in them blockchain-based and connected to other bodies.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4670" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-World.jpg" alt="bitcoin" width="646" height="395" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-World.jpg 900w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-World-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-World-768x469.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-World-600x367.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blockchain-World-450x275.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This mega-blockchain will strive to satisfy the following requirements:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain onboarding of the general public.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seamless integration with existing blockchains.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing scale and speed limits.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improbable only a few years ago, the technology was already described in white papers of </span><a href="https://whycardano.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardano</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/369141423/Telegram-Open-Network#from_embed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TON</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2019-2020, we will witness a blockchain of blockchains, with million transactions per second, as well as the tokenization of many businesses across the majority of industries. These enormous </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blockchain platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will bring in new levels decentralization and data accessibility, as well as new waves of technological disruption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years passed since the inception of Bitcoin. Although this might seem like a long time in our fast-paced world, the opposite is true.
