								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical sphere makes use of algorithms and software to approximate human knowledge when analyzing complex information connected to healthcare. AI-based programs are aimed at analyzing how medical prevention or treatment methods are related to the final result.</p>
<p>The medical sphere is the main field of investment in AI. Smart medical products, services, and processes are already being developed by companies such as IBM, Google, Apple, and many others.</p>
<h2>What AI Is and Why It Is Important in Health Care</h2>
<p>Broadly speaking, AI allows computers to learn from their experiences, adapt to set parameters, and perform tasks that used to be performed only by human beings. In most cases of AI implementation, from playing chess to driverless cars, developers must apply deep learning and natural language processing. These technologies make it possible to teach computers to perform certain tasks by processing enormous amounts of data and identifying patterns.</p>
<p>The medical sphere can already be considered one of the most promising in terms of AI usage. AI applications can massively improve the accuracy of diagnoses, simplify the lives of people who have various illnesses, and accelerate the production and release of novel drugs.</p>
<p>Today, doctors use numerous devices to facilitate diagnosis, monitor patients’ conditions, and perform surgical operations. However, it has recently become clear that AI is capable of many other things. For example, social media can help determine the dangers that threaten a person’s health.</p>
<p>The greatest achievement of AI in health care is connected to the collection and storage of data. For instance, electronic medical records (EMRs) store all data about a patient’s illness, the services provided, and other medical documents. However, the EMR market is controlled by a very small group of companies, and the programs themselves can’t be called flawless. The people who use them are irritated by pop-ups.</p>
<p>Also, robots that assist in performing operations are not science fiction anymore. In 2000, Intuitive Surgical released the<a href="https://www.davincisurgery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Da Vinci surgical system</a>, which was able to perform coronary bypass surgery. After a large investment, it was also taught how to remove prostate cancer.</p>

<p>Although AI is becoming more and more proficient, doctors still spend a lot of time communicating with patients and conducting diagnostics, but it is believed that in the future, they will only control this process, reducing the workload of therapists. Many of them already use special applications and other tools.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at some examples of AI in health care.</p>
<h2>How AI Is Implemented In Health Care: Examples Of Devices and Other Novel Technology</h2>
<h3>1. Thoroughly Process Patient Data</h3>
<p>For competent treatment and accurate diagnoses, doctors must study patient data: pictures, test results, examination protocols, and anamnesis containing complete information. Sometimes, even experienced doctors are not able to see the full picture because the data is not systematized.</p>
<p>According to Google Labs, one in ten patients suffers because of an incorrect diagnosis. It is believed that AI can solve this problem. Google’s specialists are already working in some hospitals, where the<a href="https://health.google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Google Deepmind Health</a> program analyzes the available information about patients’ symptoms and provides a list of recommendations. The doctor, using the tips from the system, prescribes a course of treatment. The<a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> IBM Watson Health</a> program also allows users to make diagnoses; it can recognize cardiomyopathy, thrombosis, heart attacks.</p>
<p>Thanks to AI, it’s possible to assess the impact of drugs on the human body, helping doctors understand how the unique features of the patient’s genetic structure affect the course of the disease and what effect a new drug can have. With the help of the<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> IBM Watson Health Cloud app</a>, the doctor receives and analyzes data about the patient’s body from an electronic bracelet and can then select an effective course of treatment.</p>
<h3>2. Diagnostics</h3>
<p>Nowadays, AI can recognize the symptoms of malignant neoplasms to diagnose visual disorders, tuberculosis, and brain disorders. An example is the<a href="https://ada.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ada</a> service. This mobile app generates questions, and then the user describes their symptoms, after which Ada searches for information about the problem and gives recommendations. Similar services can indicate diseases, including diabetes. For instance, a special application called<a href="https://www.sensely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sense.ly</a> has been developed for the people who have recently been to the hospital. It analyzes the user’s health status in real-time and then sends this data to the therapist.</p>
<p>Novel technology such as genetic analysis is gaining popularity as DNA analysis makes it possible to identify a person’s predisposition to certain diseases, such as diabetes, stomach ulcers, and more. Furthermore, one project,<a href="https://www.northshore.org/pharmacogenomics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> MedClueRx</a>, allows users to determine which medications can help with depression, epilepsy, and diseases of the nervous system.</p>
<p>We can’t help but mention a service that can replace a personal doctor.<a href="https://medwhat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> MedWhat AI</a> is a mobile phone app with a built-in speech recognition function. The app takes an interest in the user’s health and answers various questions, such as how to get rid of a headache.</p>
<p>In the near future, MedWhat will grant access to patients’ medical history and genetic information.</p>
<h3>3. Processing Huge Amounts Of Information</h3>
<p>It’s a well-known fact that AI can process several thousand pages per second when searching for the necessary information. Every twenty minutes or so, a new medical article appears in the world. Therefore, an AI-based decision support system, CDSS, was created to help medical workers. It combines information and data on patients’ health indicators and their medical history.</p>
<h3>4. The Creation Of Drugs</h3>
<p>Drugs are complex organic compounds, and finding the right structure takes a long time. Before getting to the market, a drug goes through many checks and tests, but that does not guarantee that the drug will be effective. More than 50% of new cancer drugs do not have a noticeable effect on the patient.</p>
<p>AI is designed to more accurately model the composition of drugs. In the future, researchers will be able to set the necessary functions, and AI will form the chemical structure of the drug. Even today, a service called<a href="https://www.atomwise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Atomwise</a> uses AI to find the optimal drug formula.</p>
<h2>Powerful Advantages Of AI In The Healthcare Industry</h2>
<p>Scientists hope that with the help of AI, it will soon be possible to develop ultra-precise (or precision) medicine and assign individualized treatment to each patient, taking into account unique genetic and other features. The US has already announced the launch of the first projects for the development of precision medicine.</p>
<p>Medical and technological advances over the last 50 years have allowed us to bring health care to a new level.</p>
<p><strong>New AI applications and systems have a number of undeniable advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased computing power, leading to faster data collection and processing</li>
<li>Increased volume and availability of health-related data obtained from doctors’ and patients’ personal and medical devices</li>
<li>Increased genomic sequencing databases</li>
<li>Introduction of electronic medical records.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why AI Implementation In Health Care May Turn Out Complicated</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there are several obstacles to the introduction of AI technologies in medicine. Questions often arise from medical professionals themselves, who have a reasonable distrust of some innovations.</p>
<p>What is the cause of the problems? Let’s try to understand.</p>
<p>The main barrier to the future of AI in medicine is ensuring data privacy and security. With AI, there is a risk of revealing confidential data from patients’ medical history. Moreover, there is the risk of deliberate hacking to harm a huge number of people by, for example, causing insulin overdoses in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>The second problem is the inaccurate operation of the algorithms. A recent example is the IBM Watson Health algorithm (known as Watson for Oncology). The algorithm is used by hundreds of hospitals around the world to recommend treatment for cancer patients, but it was based on a small number of synthetic cases and a very limited amount of real data. Many of its treatment recommendations were wrong. For example, it suggested the use of an incompatible medication for a patient with severe bleeding, which is a clear contraindication.</p>
<p>Another problem is bias. Low socioeconomic status is the main risk factor for premature mortality. The disproportionate use of AI for the rich while the poor can’t afford it can increase the existing health gap. The resulting bias due to the lack of inclusion of minorities in data sets is closely related to this problem. For instance, some algorithms in dermatology diagnose melanoma, but they do not take into account skin color. It is necessary to eliminate prejudice and seek medical research that provides a real representation of the population.</p>
<h2>How AI Will Transform Health Care In The Future</h2>
<p>Medical futurist Bertalan Mesko once said that AI is the stethoscope of the 21st century. He noted that a simple instrument like a stethoscope was something the medical community did not want to recognize at first. It took several decades for doctors to start using it. The same thing is happening now with AI—one tries to make the most of it while another is afraid of it.</p>
<p>AI technologies, machine learning, and neural networks simplify the lives of doctors greatly. Innovations in medicine make it possible to diagnose diseases more accurately, find medicines faster, and track the condition of patients. An impressive number of novel technologies are being developed now, and more are yet to come! Let’s look at some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google</strong> is working on creating an algorithm that will analyze EMR data and find important patterns. The technology will help doctors predict the development of the patients’ conditions and will tell how long patients should stay in the hospital, as well as calculate the probability of death.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft</strong> is using AI to develop cancer drugs and treatments. The project includes a mathematical analysis of cell development. The main idea is to apply to malignant cells the same method of struggle as to failures in computer programs. [MG1] The company also created a public service called Microsoft Healthcare Bot, which offers to use medical institutions in the development of virtual assistants and chatbots to solve various medical problems.</li>
<li><strong>IBM</strong> is developing AI-based systems in the field of cancer treatment and has already spent more than $4 billion to buy several companies with huge reserves of medical data. The Watson Group, whose technology IBM<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/technology/ibm-is-counting-on-its-bet-on-watson-and-paying-big-money-for-it.html?_r=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> plans</a> to adapt for health care, was created in early 2014 and now employs about 10,000 people. The main task of Watson is to understand questions formulated in natural language and find answers to them with the help of AI.</li>
<li><strong>Medtronic and IBM</strong> are jointly developing an application to monitor the treatment of people with diabetes.<a href="https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/products/sugar.iq-diabetes-assistant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Software Sugar.IQ</a> is a smart assistant for diabetes that will be able to predict critical decreases in blood sugar three hours before the patient shows symptoms. Data from 600 anonymous patients was used to create the technology. People can track their condition using a mobile app and special medical devices.</li>
<li><strong>Intel</strong> is developing AI-based programs that can identify patients at risk for dangerous diseases and offer treatment options.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is only a small part of the opportunities that AI has brought to the healthcare sector.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If previous years were mostly marked by the exciting evolution of emerging technologies, 2020 will be different. Technology advances will often be accompanied by various public and private issues that companies and the public will need to consider and deal with. Still, this doesn’t mean 2020 won’t hold anything exciting, or that the big-scale adoption of new technologies will stop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will make projections across 5 technology areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI algorithms in fake news and the future of media</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The not-so-comfortable truth about the state of AR &amp; VR adoption </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endpoint growth, edge computing, and other IoT industry trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial organizations embracing a shared ecosystem</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First steps of face recognition technology in financial services</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many interesting developments to talk about. Let’s start.</span></p>
<h2><strong>AI Trends: Algorithms in Media &amp; Fake News</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media industry has already seen AI-driven virtual TV presenters </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJcdVjkqiW8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The technology paves the way for a potential revolution in the industry, allowing media companies to produce a lot of content on-the-fly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, over the last two years, the public, the media, governmental organizations, and prominent artists have grown increasingly alarmed about how deepfakes can sway opinions online, influencing political events. In 2017, the University of Washington created the notorious </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/01/business/pentagons-race-against-deepfakes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deepfake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmUC4m6w1wo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Barack Obama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there was a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a deepfake video of Mark Zuckerberg, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE1KWpoX9Hk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other examples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The resemblance between the real and fake political figures proved almost uncanny, prompting discussions about the big perils of deepfake technology and other AI uses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, doctored videos can be spotted upon closer examination, but the technology keeps evolving, while easy-to-use deepfake creation tools are available online. Although </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251736/deepfake-propaganda-misinformation-troll-video-hoax" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">current countermeasures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can detect deepfakes and their creators quickly and easily, this may change soon: the technology is evolving, so the countermeasures will need to evolve as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fighting fake articles online will be more challenging, though. MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) has been going to great lengths to showcase the scale of the problem. CSAIL has conducted two scientific investigations (publishing a paper for each in the August of 2019), and both showed that current AI-driven fake news detecting systems, no matter how sophisticated, are not effective enough and face many nuanced challenges.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/15/mit-csail-fights-fake-news-with-ai/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With other companies joining the battle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, (including Facebook), this means that we will definitely see more sophisticated AI tools aimed at reducing the quantity and impact of fake news in 2020 and beyond, across the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The laws will follow suit as well. In 2020, we may expect new deepfake and fake news scandals, hearings on that cases, as well as first instances of comprehensive regulation in the most progressive countries. All popular platforms would use AI algorithms to automatically detect and block deepfakes and fake news, as well as trace their creators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, trends in AI will be a hot topic in 2020.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Augmented &amp; Virtual Reality Trends Slow Down</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although established companies use AR in </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-brands-use-augmented-reality-in-manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacturing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/microsoft-hololens-usage-in-construction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-ar-apps-changed-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other industries, the general adoption progresses slowly. Games and gamified customer experiences continue to be the main driver for both AR and VR. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/future-ar-vr-survey/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a survey by XRDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fifty-nine percent of AR and VR projects are game-related. This won’t change anytime soon, at least for VR. Steam will be pushing its </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976234/valve-half-life-alyx-steamvr-index-headset-gaming-storefront-platform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SteamVR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platform with the recently announced Half-Life: Alyx, driving the competition on the VR market. Still, the adoption of both technologies continues to grow steadily in other industries, like education and training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As AR has been growing slowly in the last two years, there is no indication this will change in 2020, despite the release of HoloLens 2 in November 2019. There is the usual back-and-forth in the rumours about Apple’s AR headset, but hard evidence on whatever the company is developing will are non-existent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, we can expect AR to continue breathing new life into familiar experiences. Readers tired of consuming content the old way will definitely enjoy immersive experiences and new story angles enabled by the technology, like those seen in The New York Times </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/augmented-reality" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR/VR section</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and by </span><a href="https://time.com/5628880/time-immersive-app-ar-vr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIME’s new AR/VR app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for other augmented reality trends, the technology will also help ecommerce drive sales in 2020 and beyond. As customers are tired of the same types of ads and their ubiquity, brands will follow into the steps of Instagram (who released its </span><a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spark AR Studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to public this year), building AR catalogues of their goods and creating digital experiences with AR lenses in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR lenses and filters are booming, but they should be approached carefully by development teams in the future. For example, Instagram removed filters that depict or promote cosmetic surgery amid concerns they </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50152053"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harm mental health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR try-in on web pages and in mobile apps would also gain more traction. This option is more cost-effective compared to other AR solutions as well as convenient for users, who would only need to open the camera on their smartphone to try a T-shirt or sunglasses on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002243591930020X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by four UK universities, AR improves decision comfort, prompts users to give positive word-of-mouth recommendations, and drives sales of more expensive products.  </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17616" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1024x683.jpg" alt="augmented reality trends" width="780" height="520" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big-scale adoption of AR will continue in 2020 with products like Adobe’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/adobe-launches-aero-its-ar-authoring-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allows designers to create AR experience without coding easily. The iPad app gives users a step-by-step guide on how to build AR scenes, allowing them to use their existing assets from the Adobe Creative Cloud. The app allows to create basic AR experiences, with the full-fledged version coming to desktop in 2020. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Internet of Things — Adoption Continues  </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the IoT industry trends are connected to streamlining existing IoT-driven operations further, sustating IoT device growth, and building massive ecosystems.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Tapping into IoT Metadata</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last decade, enterprises have been gathering and using data from smart endpoint devices in their IoT ecosystems to a great extent. The next step will be </span><a href="https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/internet-of-things/5-emerging-iot-trends-to-watch-in-2020/3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using that data’s metadata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to drive intelligence systems, increasing the level of personalization further, and giving context to otherwise incomprehensive scenarios in data sets. As a result, the companies will be able to structure unstructured data and improve the process of developing their cognitive systems.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Confident Endpoint Growth</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying on the subject of endpoints, their number will grow in 2020, as devices like smart meters, smart lighting, and smart air conditioning are becoming increasingly common in commercial and residential markets. </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-08-29-gartner-says-5-8-billion-enterprise-and-automotive-io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Gartner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the utilities industry, who is the leader in endpoint usage, was operating 1.17 billion endpoints in 2019, and the firm projects the number will grow by 14.6 percent in 2020, reaching 1.37 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the governmental sector will see a more dramatic spike: from 0.53 billion to 0.70 billion (24.3 percent). The quantity of endpoints will also grow substantially in the building automation and physical security industries. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Other Internet of Things Trends: Edge Computing, Digital Twins</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What else can be expected in the IoT area in 2020? </span><a href="https://www.techcentral.ie/iot-in-2020-awkward-times-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to IDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enterprises will begin transitioning from cloud-based IoT deployments to edge computing to further streamline IoT deployments and application performance in their ecosystems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for big trends in IoT, the Port of Rotterdam, the largest in Europe, has started a massive project of digitizing its every operation, which will continue in 2020. Some parts of the harbor are already automated, but the ports leadership and partners plan to use the digital twin technology and IoT for a complete digital transformation. The end goal is to entirely rid the port of time loss, cargo loss, spills of CO2, and safety incidents. The harbor also wants to berth crewless automated ships somewhere around 2030. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about the port’s plans and progress in detail in the video:</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Port of Rotterdam: Europe&#039;s Strongest Digital Twin Case Study | IoT World Europe 2018 webinar" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_ihbnUuAAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Open &amp; Decentralized Finance</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all likelihood, 2020 will be a watermark year for banks and financial institutions, as they face the inevitability of a large-scale transformation. The concept of open finance — an ecosystem of shared services that converges users and companies in one place to enable better efficiency and experiences — will be the overarching trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that financial organizations will have shared transaction data, IT infrastructure, and cross-compatible systems, while the ecosystem itself will be enabled by distributed technologies and more sophisticated and accessible APIs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed technology will play a key role in the evolution of the entire industry, giving way to decentralized financial services: lending, borrowing, and other financial operations will be provided on decentralized distributed platforms. Banks will use distributed ledgers to issue bonds (</span><a href="https://media.consensys.net/5-sibos-takeaways-the-future-of-finance-according-to-banks-and-institutions-a45fd53298fe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Societe Generale and Santander did</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), as digital markets with tokenized financial instruments will emerge. Payments, meanwhile, will be transferred to permission-based distributed networks to enable high security and speed.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Face Recognition in Financial Services</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As facial recognition is available in more and more smartphones and can help financial organizations cut costs and simplify operations and customer experiences, we can expect more financial services that use face recognition at different customer touchpoints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users will be able to verify different actions related to their accounts in seconds by letting smartphones scan their faces. Still, this will require a high level of security from both the financial institutions, smartphone designers, and software teams behind mobile operating systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of a federated identity — using your face to manage all of your financial operations — is also on the table, but it will take time to evolve. Mexico has </span><a href="https://observer.com/2019/11/trueface-artificial-intelligence-facial-recognition-future-banking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a biometric security mandate to bring this idea to life, so we can probably expect other countries to follow suit in 2020.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Summing Up Technology Trends for 2020</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although major breakthroughs are not in the cards, 2020 will be yet another eventful year for the tech industry and the world. AI will play the most important role at the both sides of the fake news war in 2020, prompting governments to come up with never-before-seen laws. AR adoption has slowed down significantly, and this may continue until Apple releases its first AR device. IoT adoption continues, as companies across industries tap into new types of data, use more endpoints, and find ways to streamline deployments; massive IoT projects like digitization of the Port of Rotterdam are also underway. With no time left to postpone transformation, financial organizations embrace modern times with big plans for setting up shared systems to deliver next-gen user experiences. Finally, face recognition is slowly coming to financial operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s still going to be exciting. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/intellectsoft" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stay tuned</a>.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence has blessed the enterprises with a very useful innovation – the chatbot. Today, almost every other consumer firm is investing in this niche to streamline its customer support operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, despite being around for years, numerous firms haven’t yet succeeded in an efficient deployment of this technology. Perhaps, most organizations stumble while deploying a chatbot owing to their lack of knowledge about the working and development of chatbots. Moreover, sometimes, they are also unclear about how a chatbot would support their day-to-day activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, with this article, we explain what chatbots are and how to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build a chatbot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that genuinely boosts your business.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is A Chatbot</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chatbot is a dedicated software developed to communicate with humans in a natural way. Most chatbots integrate with different messaging applications to develop a link with the end-users. Though, some chatbots also function as standalone apps.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17732" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot.jpg" alt="What Is A Chatbot Cover" width="650" height="562" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-300x259.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-768x664.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-600x519.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-450x389.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-1000x864.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most businesses </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build a chatbot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for managing customers and online visitors. Though, the organizations may either use them as the sole resource for customer support or, assist the human staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To manage the conversations, chatbots follow a question-answer pattern. Whereas, the recognition of the question and the delivery of an appropriate answer is powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Do Chatbots Work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core functioning of chatbots entirely depends on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Then, depending upon the requirements, an organization can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a chatbot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> empowered with Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, a chatbot works by comparing the incoming users’ queries with specified preset instructions to recognize the request. For this, it processes the queries through complex algorithms and then responds accordingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on how the chatbots process the input and how they respond, chatbots can be divided into two main types.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Processing Queries As Commands</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some chatbots work by processing incoming queries from the users as commands. These chatbots rely on a specified set of commands or rules instructed during development. The bot then responds to the users by analyzing the incoming query against the preset rules and fetching appropriate information. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17733" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-for-ecommerce-shopping-1024x461.png" alt="Processing Queries As Commands" width="1024" height="461" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-for-ecommerce-shopping-1024x461.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-for-ecommerce-shopping-300x135.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-for-ecommerce-shopping-768x346.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-for-ecommerce-shopping-600x270.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-for-ecommerce-shopping-450x203.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-for-ecommerce-shopping-1000x450.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-for-ecommerce-shopping.png 1073w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image Source:  VirtualSpirits.com</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firms having such chatbots usually mention it clearly to the users who interact with their support. The user then knows how to give the commands and extract the desired information. If a user asks something beyond the bot’s capability, it then forwards the query to a human support agent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these bots are quick and efficient, they cannot decipher queries in natural language. Therefore, they are unable to indulge in complex conversations with humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want a chatbot to quickly attend incoming user queries, and you have an idea of possible questions, you can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build a chatbot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this way by training the program accordingly. Such bots are suitable for e-commerce sites to attend sales and order inquiries, book customers’ orders, or to schedule flights.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural language processing (NLP) empowers the chatbots to conversate in a more human-like manner. At times, a user may not even detect a machine on the other side of the screen while talking to these chatbots. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17734" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/NLP-chatbot.png" alt="Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)" width="303" height="538" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/NLP-chatbot.png 303w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/NLP-chatbot-169x300.png 169w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/NLP-chatbot-253x450.png 253w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: Chatbots Magazine</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NLP-based chatbots also work on keywords that they fetch from the predefined libraries. The quality of this communication thus depends on how well the libraries are constructed, and the software running the chatbot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, these bots are jazzed-up with machine-learning to effectively understand users’ requests in the future. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbot Architecture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a chatbot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that delivers compelling results, it is important for businesses to know the workflow of these bots. From the receipt of users’ queries to the delivery of an answer, the information passes through numerous programs that help the chatbot decipher the input.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precisely, most chatbots work on three different classification approaches which further build up their basic architecture.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Pattern Matches</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pattern matching is the process that a chatbot uses to classify the content of the query and generate an appropriate response. Most of these patterns are structured in Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML). These patterns exist in the chatbot’s database for almost every possible query. Together, multiple patterns form a hierarchical structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, to fetch responses in the cases where queries are outside of the related patterns, algorithms assist the program by reducing the classifiers and creating a manageable structure.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a user enters a message, it reaches the NLU engine of the chatbot program for analysis and response generation. Precisely, NLU comprises of three different concepts according to which it analyzes the message.</span></p>
<p><b>Entity:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> An entity is the core idea of a chatbot that a firm decides. For instance, a chatbot for an online store may have payment systems or order tracking systems as entities. </span></p>
<p><b>Context:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While scrutinizing the message, the NLU does not access the users’ text history. It means it analyzes the query independent of the previous conversation. Hence, to generate a proper response, the program stores the text from the users’ conversations as separate phrases flagged with distinct parameters, such as “Ordering Jacket”, or “Restaurant: KFC”. This helps the program to relate intents without the need to evaluate previous chat.</span></p>
<p><b>Intent:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The other thing for which NLU analyzes the query is the Intent or the action from the chatbot in response to the message. For instance, the chatbot will give the same response to the user against the queries “Do you have blue fur jackets?”, “I want some nice blue fur jackets”, “Show me a good fur jacket in blue” since all of these messages trigger the same command for blue fur jackets.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/natural-language-processing-why-the-machines-still-struggle-to-understand-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural Language Processing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NLP) makes the chatbot understand input messages and generate an appropriate response. It converts the users’ text or speech data into structured data, which is then processed to fetch a suitable answer. This entire process consists of the following steps. </span></p>
<p><b>Tokenization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The program breaks the string of words into discrete fragments (tokens) that bear a linguistic representation with a unique value for the application.</span></p>
<p><b>Normalization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It analyzes the text for any possible misspells or typographical errors that could change the intended meaning of users’ queries.</span></p>
<p><b>Entity Recognition:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The chatbot analyzes the text to identify the topic being talked about. It recognizes the entity by searching for a similar category of words, users’ data, or any other required information.</span></p>
<p><b>Dependency Parsing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The program scrutinizes the text for nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, and phrases to find any dependent information conveyed by the user.</span></p>

<p><b>Sentiment Analysis:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The chatbot software assesses the users’ experiences by analyzing the text. It then forwards the query to a human if needed.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Knowledge Base</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After deciding the intent, the chatbot interacts with the knowledge base to fetch information for the response. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knowledge base serves as the main response center bearing all the information about the products, services, or the company. It has answers to all the FAQs, guides, and every possible information that a customer may be interested to know. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Data Storage</span></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17736" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/database.jpg" alt="Data Storage Cover" width="652" height="413" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/database.jpg 910w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/database-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/database-768x486.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/database-600x380.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/database-450x285.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another critical component of a chatbot architecture is database storage built on the platform during development. It holds all the chat logs and analytics. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbot Architecture Diagram</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of how simple or complex a chatbot architecture is, the usual workflow and structure of the program remain almost the same. It only gets more complicated after including additional components for a more natural communication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is the basic chatbot architecture diagram that depicts how the program processes a request.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17737" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-architecture-diagram.png" alt="Data Storage Cover" width="750" height="373" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-architecture-diagram.png 750w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-architecture-diagram-300x149.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-architecture-diagram-600x298.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-architecture-diagram-450x224.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How To Build A Chatbot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> From Scratch</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it is quite easy for businesses to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a chatbot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and improve their customer support. One can either develop a chatbot from scratch by using background knowledge of coding languages. Or, thanks to the engineers that there now exist numerous tools online that facilitate chatbot development even by a non-technical user.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17739" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-design.jpg" alt="How To Build A Chatbot From Scratch Cover" width="653" height="497" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-design.jpg 910w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-design-300x228.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-design-768x585.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-design-600x457.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-design-450x343.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, the core steps to building a chatbot remain the same regardless of the technical method you choose. Let’s take a quick look at these steps. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Define Goals For Your Chatbot</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to define the goals for your chatbot based on your business requirements and your customers’ demands. When you know what your chatbot should and would do, moving on to the other steps gets easy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, make sure that your first chatbot should be easy to use for both the customers as well as your staff. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Decide A Communication Channel</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots are flexible enough to integrate with various types of texting platforms. Depending upon your business needs, the ease of customers to reach you, and the provision of relevant API by your desired chatbot, you can choose a suitable communication channel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, you can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build a chatbot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your company website or mobile app. Likewise, you can also integrate your chatbot with Facebook Messenger, Skype, any other messaging application, or even with SMS channels. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Design Conversational Language And Architecture</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering your business requirements and the workload of customer support agents, you can design the conversation of the chatbot. A simple chatbot is just enough to provide immediate assistance to the customers. These bots usually follow FAQ-styled messages. Therefore, you need to develop a conversational style covering all possible questions your customers may ask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from writing simple messages, you should also create a storyboard and dialogue flow for the bot. This includes designing different variations of a message that impart a similar meaning. Doing so will help the bot create communicate in a smooth manner even when it has to say the same thing repeatedly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas, the more advanced chatbots supporting human-like talks need a more sophisticated conversational architecture. Such chatbots also implement machine learning technology to improve their conversations.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Choose Apps For Integration</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As explained above, a chatbot architecture necessarily includes a knowledge base or a response center to fetch appropriate replies. For this purpose, you can either develop a dedicated knowledge base. Or, you can also integrate any existing apps or services that include all the information possibly required by your customers. Likewise, you can also integrate your present databases to the chatbot for future data storage purposes.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Data Collection</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sole purpose to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a chatbot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to ensure smooth communication without annoying your customers. For this, you must train the program to appropriately respond to every incoming query. Although, it is impossible to predict what question or request your customer will make. But, if you keep collecting all the conversations and integrate the stored chats with the bot, it will eventually help the program recognize the context of different incoming queries. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Select Development Platform</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, numerous chatbot development tools are available that create smart chatbots in a short time. These tools employ NLP and allow creating chatbots according to the business requirements. These tools are desirable for every business since they require no coding from your end. Some of these </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/quick-chatbot-prototyping/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chatbot maker tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include,</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bottr.me/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bottr</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas, if you are more interested in creating your own bot and you know how to code, you can use dedicated </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/advanced-natural-language-processing-tools-for-bot-makers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chatbot development frameworks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example,</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://wit.ai/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook Wit.AI</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/how-to-build-a-chatbot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM Watson</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Alexa Skill Kit</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://dev.botframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Bot Framework</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://dialogflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Dialogflow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (former Api.ai)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, if you want to have a customized chatbot, but you are unable to build one on your own, you can get them online. Services like </span><a href="https://botlist.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Botlist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, provide ready-made bots that seamlessly integrate with your respective platform in a few minutes. Though, with these services, you won’t get many options to customize your bot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, you can hire </span><a href="https://ai.intellectsoft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online AI development solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Such firms provide customized services for building your chatbot according to your instructions and business needs. Whereas, with these services, you do not have to hire separate AI developers in your team.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Dialogue Flow Implementation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final step of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chatbot development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to implement the entire dialogue flow by creating classifiers. This will map a structure to let the chatbot program decipher an incoming query, analyze the context, fetch a response and generate a suitable reply according to the conversational architecture. Regardless of the development solution, the overall dialogue flow is responsible for a smooth chat with a user.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Testing And Deployment</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last phase of building a chatbot is its real-time testing and deployment. Though, both the processes go together since you can only test the chatbot in real-time as you deploy it for the real users. But that is very important for you to assess if the chatbot is capable enough to meet your customers’ needs. Monitor the entire conversations, collect data, create logs, analyze the data, and keep improving the bot for better conversations.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things To Consider While Choosing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbot Platforms</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before investing in a development platform, make sure to evaluate its usefulness for your business considering the following points.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User-friendly UI/UX</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed for building the bot</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NLP provision</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support for languages</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compatibility with front-end integrations, such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Slack.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back-end integrations such as CRM solutions, MongoDB or other databases, robotic platforms (like Blue Prism), and analytics platforms.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing plans (freemium, premium)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analytics and feedback provision</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expandability</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Long Does It Take To Build A Chatbot</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total time for successful </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chatbot development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and deployment varies according to the procedure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the online solutions offering ready-made chatbots let you deploy a chatbot in less than an hour. With these services, you just have to choose the bot that is closest to your business niche, set up its conversation, and you are good to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, building a chatbot via self-service platforms such as Chatfuel takes a little long. Since these platforms allow you to customize your chatbot, it may take anywhere from a few hours to a few days to deploy your bot, depending upon the architectural complexity.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17740" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-platforms.jpg" alt="How Long Does It Take To Build A Chatbot Cover" width="651" height="434" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-platforms.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-platforms-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-platforms-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-platforms-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-platforms-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-platforms-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas, if you choose to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a chatbot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from scratch, then the total time gets even longer. Here’s the usual breakdown of the time spent on completing various development phases.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Integration With Chat Platform:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Based on the complexity, integrating the chatbot with a single chat platform may take 40-56 hours.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Developing Conversational UI:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Designing Command Language UI takes about 40-56 hours. Whereas, creating a chatbot with Natural Language UI may take around 120-160 hours.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Adapting Business Logic:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Integrating business logic, in case you already have API for your websites or mobile applications, takes about 120-160 hours. Whereas, if you build the business logic from scratch, the time may extend up to 192 hours.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, building a chatbot by hiring a software development company also takes longer. Precisely, it may take around 4-6 weeks for the successful building and deployment of a customized chatbot.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping Up</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots initially emerged as a luxury for organizations. Yet, they have now become a necessity for a thriving business. These bots help the firms in keeping their customers satisfied with continuous support. Moreover, they facilitate the staff by providing assistance in managing different tasks, thereby increasing their productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatbots are equally beneficial for all large-scale, mid-level, and startup companies. All it takes for the firms to succeed with more sales, increased revenue, and growing customer base, is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build a chatbot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that meets their requirements, is easy to maintain, and expandable according to their business needs. The more the firms invest in chatbots, the greater are the chances of their growth and popularity among the customers.   </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal technology, or legaltech (less often </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawtech</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), is software and technologies that help law firms streamline core processes, like practice and document management, billing and accounting, and e-discovery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legaltech emerged as a response to the challenges the industry faced following the </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/749982dc-90c7-11e8-b639-7680cedcc421"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial crisis of 2008</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They included in-house lawyers’ greater demands on firms, pressure to cut costs, lack of standardization in client procurement across departments, attracting and charging clients in the competitive market after the recession, as well as competition from new companies that rejected the traditional law model. On top of that, law firms needed to plow through vast amounts of data since email communication has started becoming the new normal in the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, legaltech has grown to encompass, on the one hand, the software and technology tools that simplify and streamline law practice for lawyers, and on the other, digital tools that simplify the acquisition and management of law services for clients by reducing or eliminating the need to consult a lawyer (or making it easier to find the right one quickly). </span></p>
<h2><strong>Technologies &amp; Application Areas</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a higher level, legaltech is the industry’s way of performing digital transformation, that is, using software and technologies to simplify operations, become leaner, cater to modern customers, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legaltech encompasses the following software solutions and technologies:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workflow software tools</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workflow tools – systems that allow lawyers to digitalise and automate their workflows.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart contracts – self-executing clauses in legal contracts enabled by DLT, Internet of Things (IoT), and other. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-discovery tools — solutions that simplify and automate e-discovery stages, for example machine learning algorithms that collect and process documents and prepare it for a lawyer to review.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal chatbots – automated rule-based tools enabled by AI/ML that allow users to get answers to basic legal inquiries in a chat or messenger.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online marketplaces — digital platforms that help clients find the right lawyer faster.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud-based databases — data is gathered in a single data warehouse, where it can be accessed by employees across departments.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data security — ensuring the highest level of security for legal records with DLT.</span></li>

<h2><strong>Legaltech vs Lawtech — What Is the Difference?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@thelawboutiquelondon/is-there-a-difference-between-lawtech-and-legaltech-68f776d5ab98"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some experts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reckon legaltech and lawtech serve different purposes, with the first referring to software and technologies lawyers use to streamline their work (e-discovery, AI/ML document review), and the second encompassing products for their clients (legal chabots, online marketplaces). </span><a href="https://www.legalgeek.co/learn/lawtech-legaltech-wtf/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other lawyers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reckon lawtech is not a fitting name for the field, as it implies the subject of law in general rather than an industry. In different publications, lawtech and legaltech are used interchangeably, but legaltech more often still. As of now, using both makes equal sense; time will tell which of terms will stick. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Use Cases: What Legaltech Benefits Firms Can Expect</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While legal tech is a nascent field, law firms are already leveraging what it has to offer, digititalizing their workflows, improving customer experiences, helping clients to return virtual money, and more. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Big Data &amp; Cloud — M&amp;A &amp; Portfolio Management</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking for a way to review large patent portfolios, lawyers from </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/87dd18d2-94bd-11e8-95f8-8640db9060a7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird &amp; Bird</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have teamed up with their client Nokia (the technology company) and a range of experts from different fields for a solution. Their joint effort resulted in Pattern — a cloud-based big data tool that simplifies M&amp;As and client portfolio management and includes details of every patent ever published. The tool proved efficient and was rolled out to Bird &amp; Bird’s clients in 2017.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Mobile — Workflow &amp; Document Management </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our clients, a long-established U.S. law firm, needed to transfer their workflows and document management as well as minimize the heavy paperwork common to a law firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A comprehensive and handy mobile app proved to be the fitting solution. It empowered the firm’s lawyers with the following features: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediate access to сritical legal documents; files and documents can be securely shared between the firm’s lawyers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys can send bills and receive payments easily</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HR center with powerful employee management tools</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notification center: clients and lawyers are always notified about changes and updates</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">White Label solution</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Artificial Intelligence Document Analysis</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to free the legal industry from the massive amounts of paperwork. A good example comes from Luminance — an AI platform for due diligence, insurance, contract, and compliance management. The </span><a href="https://www.techworld.com/picture-gallery/startups/uks-leading-lawtech-startups-3680397/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses computer vision, machine learning (ML) algorithms, and probability statistics to analyze documents much quicker than a human. Since it launch in 2015, the AI platform gained wide recognition among law firms. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Customer Experience Management</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CX platforms can make a big difference in a legal firm’s operations. In one of our projects, we helped a U.S. law firm fully digitalize their legal consulting with such a platform. It consists of two parts. Customers use a mobile app to request legal help by creating tickets with basic information and attached documents. On the other side, the firm’s representatives and employees are assigned with tickets in a web-based interface with a simple workflow (in style of JIRA) to manage those requests. If the representative cannot address the issue, it is automatically passed further to the firm’s in-house experts. The platform also gathers data, accumulating a knowledge base to simplify the process of solving similar issues in the future for every representative and in-house lawyer.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Illegal Transactions Tracking with DLT</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the legal industry heavily relies on tradition, it already started leveraging what distributed ledger technology (DLT) has to offer. Josias Dewey, a partner at Holland &amp; Knight and a software engineer, helps the firm’s clients create DLT proof-of-concepts applications. For example, he helped develop a </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/68811bac-f262-11e8-9623-d7f9881e729f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DLT tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that helps track and freeze illegal virtual currency transactions, helping a client to return $500,000 lost as the result of a hack. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facial recognition is a technology that combines sophisticated software driven by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms with cameras to collect data about a person’s age, gender, and ethnicity. Popularized by Apple’s iPhone X and already used in law enforcement and airports, the technology is gradually (but stealthily) becoming part of customer experiences in retail spaces and hotels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are industry-leading companies using the technology? What benefits do they plan to gain by implementing facial recognition? Is the technology regulated? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us as we explore these questions below. </span></p>
<h2><strong>1) Facial Recognition in Retail </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>CaliBurger — Loyalty Program, In-store Experience</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Californian burger company CaliBurger installed kiosks with facial recognition capabilities at one of their restaurants in Pasadena. Linked to CaliBurger’s loyalty program, the kiosks recognize customers when they approach, load their loyalty accounts, and show favorite and past orders. The customers do not need to add any account details or swipe their cards. As a result, Caliburger is able to remove friction from the ordering process almost entirely, speeding it up significantly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the kiosks are in the testing mode. Caliburger plans to roll out the technology in other restaurants over time. “Facial recognition is part of our broader strategy,” </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/21/16805000/caliburger-nec-face-recognition-order-food" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO of Cali Group John Miller in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See the video:</span></p>
<p><iframe title="The Future of Retail Technology Comes to CaliBurger" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEhhdoPlsE4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caliburger’s facial recognition technology works only with prior customer consent, and the company stresses that they do not store the facial images. </span></p>
<h3><strong>7-Eleven — Advanced Facial Recognition in Thailand</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2018, 7-Eleven </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/7-eleven-facial-recognition-technology-introduced-in-thailand-2018-3?r=UK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">installed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> facial recognition software into 11,000 stores in Thailand. Coupled with behaviour analytics, the solution is used to track loyalty cardholders, monitor customer traffic and stock levels, suggest products for purchase, as well as recognise the emotions of shoppers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thailand’s population reaches almost 69 million people, and 10 million of them go to a 7-Eleven store each day. It is fair to say that the company is planning to get a substantial ROI on the technology, and improve the numbers. The implementation might also be connected to the current rise of facial recognition technology across Asia, especially in China, where people can use it to buy products, withdraw cash from ATMs, as well as get a loan. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Saks Fifth Avenue — Organized Retail Crime Prevention</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An early adopter of facial recognition technology, luxury brand Saks installed it into its flagship store in Toronto’s Eaton Centre to fight organized retail crime/loss prevention. The facial recognition algorithms track the store visitors and convert’s photos of suspects into biometric templates, checking them against a database of registered shoplifters. The solution allows for accessing the cameras remotely from Saks’s New York headquarters.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is an example of how facial recognition technology works in crime detection:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16556" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Iowa-Department-of-Transportation-uses-facial-recognition.jpg" alt="Facial recognition" width="800" height="569" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Iowa-Department-of-Transportation-uses-facial-recognition.jpg 800w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Iowa-Department-of-Transportation-uses-facial-recognition-300x213.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Iowa-Department-of-Transportation-uses-facial-recognition-768x546.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Iowa-Department-of-Transportation-uses-facial-recognition-600x427.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Iowa-Department-of-Transportation-uses-facial-recognition-450x320.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Iowa Department of Transportation</em></p>
<h3><strong>Walmart, Samsung, Intel, Home Depot </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home Depot has </span><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/retailers-are-using-facial-recognition-technology-too.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">merged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their marketing and security departments for a facial recognition project that would provide insight into shoppers’ in-store product browsing. Michael Weidmann, the consultant for the project, said that no company had ever considered linking the two departments before, but the number has been growing since. With Amazon leading the way with their highly sophisticated and automated Go shops, companies will leverage facial recognition in retail to attract more customers to physical stores in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanpearson/2018/03/15/3-ways-retailers-can-use-facial-recognition-to-express-better-experiences/#526fe9851766" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walmart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> patented a technology with AI facial recognition that enables cameras to capture the facial expressions of shoppers in checkout lines to measure the degree of dissatisfaction with service. The results may help the company improve the in-store experience, including in-store displays, real-time promotions, and other issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, the use of facial recognition in retail is on the rise. At the National Retail Federation 2018, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanpearson/2018/03/15/3-ways-retailers-can-use-facial-recognition-to-express-better-experiences/#526fe9851766" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samsung and AT&amp;T</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed how they plan to use it to get insights into demographics, store traffic customer behaviour patterns, and acquire other data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Intel showed a mock-up of a candy store in which a camera recognized recurring shoppers with the help of AI facial recognition, and then informed the store associates about their names, previous purchases, and product recommendations. Properly established, such facial recognition tool could empower the store associates and raise in-store customer satisfaction significantly.</span></p>
<h2><strong>2) Facial Recognition in Hospitality</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Accor Hotels — Check-In, Hotel Experience</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, Accor Hotels started trialing facial recognition technology in their Pullman hotel in São Paulo, Brazil to see how it can improve the guest experience. The opportunity was given to selected guest that are part of the loyalty program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution covers key points in Accor’s hotel experience. Guests can use facial recognition to check-in at the desk or an information pillar at the reception as well as use the technology to access their rooms. As a result, the keycards are out of the equation as the guest experience becomes more swift and streamlined. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accor Hotels lists deeper personalization and standing out from competition as other facial recognition benefits, according to Erwan Le Goff, the company&#8217;s vice-president for information technology for South America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We realize this technology is a big market differentiator and will be utilized by the sector in the years to come. &#8221; </span><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/accor-hotels-starts-facial-recognition-trials-in-brazil/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mr. Le Goff.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Marriott International — Check-in Kiosks at the Desk</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the same time in 2018, Marriott announced they are bringing facial recognition to the check-in desk in the form of kiosks. The chain started testing the technology at their two properties in China — Marriott Hangzhou and Marriot Sanya (located on island often referred to as “The Hawaii of China”). The project is also a joint effort with e-commerce giant Alibaba.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16559" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Marriott-Facial-Recognition-Check-in-Kiosk-683x1024.jpg" alt="Facial recognition in the hospitality industry" width="357" height="535" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Marriott-Facial-Recognition-Check-in-Kiosk-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Marriott-Facial-Recognition-Check-in-Kiosk-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Marriott-Facial-Recognition-Check-in-Kiosk-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Marriott-Facial-Recognition-Check-in-Kiosk-600x900.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Marriott-Facial-Recognition-Check-in-Kiosk-300x450.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Marriott-Facial-Recognition-Check-in-Kiosk-667x1000.jpg 667w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Marriott-Facial-Recognition-Check-in-Kiosk.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Marriott International has a track record of embracing cutting-edge technology to create memorable experiences for guests,” </span><a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/marriott-alibaba-facial-recognition-hotel-check-in" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Henry Lee, Chief Operations Officer and Managing Director of Marriott International Greater China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like the chain considers the implementation of facial recognition in hospitality as the next important step for the industry. If the current effort finds its success, Marriott plans to roll out the technology to all of their 6,500 properties — although no definite milestones were set.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Other Hotel Chains — VIP Identification</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to broad-based usage, facial recognition in the hospitality industry is in its young years. On top of that, it is not properly regulated yet (we will discuss this in a moment). As a result, few companies are willing to voice their efforts, let alone sit down and elaborate on them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the Guardian </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/03/revealed-facial-recognition-software-infiltrating-cities-saks-toronto"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that a number of high-end hotels in Europe are allegedly using facial recognition to identify VIPs and celebrities for preferred treatment when they enter the front door.   </span></p>
<h2><strong>3) The State of Facial Recognition Technology Regulation</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, it can be said that the facial recognition technology is not regulated. Only the states of Illinois and Texas in the United States come as exceptions. Still, the gears that facilitate the emergence of corresponding laws are already in motion, and the conversation in general has already started.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The technology is in some environments where I’m sure millions of people, in a year, or even in a month, are subjected to it,” said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, to </span><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/10/retailers-are-using-facial-recognition-technology-too.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Nobody has any idea that it’s happening, or what data is being collected, or how it’s being stored, or for how long, or who has access to it.”</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16560" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Library-photo-1024x683.jpg" alt="Facial recognition technology" width="651" height="434" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Library-photo-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Library-photo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Library-photo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Library-photo-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Library-photo-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Library-photo-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ritchie Torres, a New York City Councilman representing Bronx, introduced a bill to move the needle on the issue. It would require a business to start informing the public in case they are using the facial recognition, how long they store the data gathered by it, and who they share this data with. The legislation effort did not get traction yet, and the magazine argues that it will face serious lobbying efforts from the tech industry — citing lack of success with similar laws in Alaska, Connecticut, Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington. Trade groups and tech giants like Google and Facebook are at the forefront of the opposition, the latter being especially aggressive on the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geoff White, a privacy specialist with the Public Interest Advocacy Centre in Ottawa told </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/03/revealed-facial-recognition-software-infiltrating-cities-saks-toronto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guardian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that companies using facial recognition technology have an obligation to be more transparent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pushing tech companies to become more so and hoping to get a resolution should not be viewed as an impossible feat. After all, privacy is paramount today, and those companies that fail to follow through eventually risk losing their clients, while also losing image points along the way.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Data has long become a default setting for most IT projects. Whether it is an enterprise solution for tracking compactor sensors in an AEC project, or a e-commerce project aimed at customers across country &#8212; gathering, managing, and then leveraging large amounts of data is critical to any business in our day and age. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first aforementioned scenario, we have a massive amount of data from compactor sensors that can be used for algorithms training and AI inference deployed on the edge. Also, one partly autonomous compactor equipped with the right sensor suite could generate up to 30 TB of data daily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the second case, a countrywide e-commerce solution would serve millions of customers across many channels: mobile, desktop, chatbot service, assistant integrations with Alexa and Google Assistant, and other. The solution would also need to supports delivery operations, back-end logistics, supply chain, customer support, analytics, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These and many other cases involve millions of data points that should be integrated, analyzed, processed, and used by various teams in everyday decision making and long-term planning alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, before implementing a solution, a company needs to know which of Big Data tools and frameworks would work in their case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this guide, we will closely look at the tools, knowledge, and infrastructure a company needs to establish a Big Data process, to run complex enterprise systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the database type to machine learning engines, join us as we explore Big Data below. </span></p>
<h2><b>Big Data &amp; The Need for a Distributed Database System</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the old days, companies usually started system development from a centralized monolithic architecture. The architecture worked well for a couple of years, but was not suitable for the growing number of users and high user traction.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15922" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Centralized-System.png" alt="big data technologies and tools" width="387" height="560" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Centralized-System.png 387w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Centralized-System-207x300.png 207w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Centralized-System-311x450.png 311w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centralized System</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, software engineers started scaling the architecture vertically by using more powerful hardware increasing — with more RAM, better CPUs, and larger hard drives (there were no SSDs at that moment in time).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the system got more load, the app logic and database could be split to different machines.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15923" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Multiple-Apps-and-Databases.png" alt="tools for big data" width="387" height="356" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Multiple-Apps-and-Databases.png 387w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Multiple-Apps-and-Databases-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple Apps and Databases</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some time, we proceeded with app logic and database replication, the process of spreading the computation to several nodes and combining it with a load balancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this helped companies manage growth and serve the user. On the other hand, the process increased the cost of infrastructure support and demanded more resources from the engineering team, as they had to deal with failures of nodes, partitioning of the system, and in some cases data inconsistency that arose from misconfigurations in the database or bugs in application logic code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, software engineers faced the CAP theorem and started thinking what is more important:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) Consistency</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: every read always receives the most recent write or error, but never the old data.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) Availability</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: every request receives a response, but does not guarantee that it contains recent data.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">c) Partition Tolerance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.</span></p>
<p><b>In particular, the CAP theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two of the above guarantees.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But usage continued to grow and companies and software engineers needed to find new ways to increase the capacity of their systems. This brings us to the realm of horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available heterogeneous system architectures.</span></p>
<h2><b>Horizontally Scalable Infrastructure</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Distributed File System (DFS) as a main storage model</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google File System (GFS) served as a main model for the development community to build the Hadoop framework and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which could run MapReduce task. </span><b>The idea is to take a lot of pieces of heterogeneous hardware, and run a distributed file system for large datasets.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the data is distributed among a cluster’s many nodes, the computation is in the form of a MapReduce task. MapReduce and others schedulers assign workloads to the servers where the data is stored, and which data will be used as an input and output sources — to minimize the data transfer overhead. This principle is also called </span><b>data locality</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hadoop clusters are designed in a way that every node can fail and system will continue its operation without any interruptions. There are internal mechanisms in the architecture of the overall system that enable it to be fault-tolerant with fault-compensation capabilities.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15924" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/hdfsarchitecture-1.png" alt="best big data tools" width="874" height="604" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/hdfsarchitecture-1.png 874w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/hdfsarchitecture-1-300x207.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/hdfsarchitecture-1-768x531.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/hdfsarchitecture-1-600x415.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/hdfsarchitecture-1-450x311.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed HDFS Architecture</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Files stored in HDFS are divided into small blocks and redundantly distributed among multiple servers with a continuous process of balancing the number of available copies according to the configured parameters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the list of all architecture assumptions of HDFS architecture:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardware failure is a norm rather than an exception</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streaming data access</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large data sets with a typical file as large as gigabytes and terabytes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple coherency model that favors data appends and truncates but not updates and inserts. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving computation is cheaper than moving data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portability across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hadoop HDFS is written on Java and can be run on almost all major OS environments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of nodes in major deployments can reach hundreds of thousands with the storage capacity in hundreds of Petabytes and more. </span><b>Apple, Facebook, Uber, Netflix all are heavy users of Hadoop and HDFS.</b></p>
<h2><b>HBase: More Than A Distributed Database Architecture</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in order to improve our apps we need more than just a distributed file system. We need to have a database with fast read and write operations (HDFS and MapReduce cannot provide fast updates because they were built on the premise of a simple coherency model).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, Google has built BigTable, which has a wide-column database that works on top of GFS and features consistency and fast read and write operations. So, the open-source community has built HBase — an architecture modeled after BigTable’s architecture and using the ideas behind it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HBase a NoSQL database that works well for high throughput applications and gets all capabilities of distributed storage, including replication and fault and partition tolerance. </span><b>In other words, it is a great fit for hundreds of millions (and billions) of rows.</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15918" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/hbasearchitecture.png" alt="popular big data tools" width="966" height="632" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/hbasearchitecture.png 966w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/hbasearchitecture-300x196.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/hbasearchitecture-768x502.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/hbasearchitecture-600x393.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/hbasearchitecture-450x294.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">HBase Architecture on top of the Hadoop (</span></i><a href="http://bigdatariding.blogspot.com/2013/12/hbase-architecture.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Cassandra</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also </span><b>Cassandra</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an evolution of HBase that is not dependent on HDFS and does not have a single master node. Cassandra avoids all the complexities that arise from managing the HBase master node, which makes it a more reliable distributed database architecture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cassandra is also better in writes than HBase. More so, it better suits the always-on apps that need higher availability. Remember the CAP theorem and trade-off between consistency and availability?</span></p>
<h2><b>Machine Learning Engines &amp; Tools for Big Data Analytics</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Hive</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hive is one of the most popular Big Data tools to process the data stored in HDFS, providing reading, writing, and managing capabilities for stored data. Other important features of Hive are providing the structure on top of stored data and using SQL as the query language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hive’s main use cases involve data summarization and exploration, which can be turned into actionable insights. The specialized SQL syntax is called HiveQL, and it is easy to learn for one who is familiar with the standard SQL and the notion of key-value nature of the data, rather than standard relational RDBMS. However, for highly concurrent BI workloads, it is better to use Apache Impala, which can work on top of Hive metadata but with more capabilities.</span></p>
<h3><b>Spark</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best Big Data tools also include Spark. Spark is a fast in-memory data processing engine with an extensive development API that allows data workers to efficiently execute streaming, machine learning, and SQL workloads with fast iterative access to stored data sets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spark can be run in different job management environments, like Hadoop YARN or Mesos. It is also available in a Stand Alone mode, where it uses built-in job management and scheduling utilities.</span></p>
<h3><b>YARN</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YARN is a resource manager introduced in MRV2, which supports many apps besides Hadoop framework, like Kafka, ElasticSearch, and other custom applications.</span></p>
<h3><b>Spark MLlib</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spark MLlib is a machine learning library that provides scalable and easy-to-use tools:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common learning algorithm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s — classification, regression, clustering, and filtering</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feature extraction</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pipelines, transformation, dimensionality reduction</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persistence for algorithms</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pipelines &amp; linear algebra and statistics utilities</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>KNIME Analytics Platform</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KNIME is helpful for visualization of data pipelines and ETL processing via modular components. With minimal programming and configuration, KNIME can connect to JDBC sources and combine it in one common pipelines.</span></p>
<h3><b>Presto SQL</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interactive features of distributed data processing can be achieved with Presto SQL query engine that can easily run analytics queries against gigabytes and petabytes of data. The tool was developed at Facebook, where it was used on a 300 PB data warehouse with 1000 employees working in a tool daily and executing 30000 queries that in total scan up to one PB each daily. This puts Presto high up in the list of solid tools for Big Data processing.</span></p>
<h2><b>Big Data Tools for Streams &amp; Messages</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another modality of data processing is handling data as streams of messages. This typically involves operations connected to data from sensors, ads analytics, customer actions, and high volumes of data from sensors like cameras of LiDARs from autonomous systems.</span></p>
<h3><b>Kafka</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kafka is currently the leading distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use cases include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messaging</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: traditional message broker pattern of data processing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website Activity Tracking</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: real-time publish-subscribe feeds in domains of page views, searches, and other user interactions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metrics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: operational monitoring data processing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Log Aggregation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: collecting physical log files and store them for further processing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stream Processing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: multi-stage data processing pipelines.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event Sourcing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: support of apps built with stored event sequences that can be replayed and applied again for deriving a consistent system state.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit Log</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the type of data stored in distributed system that ensures the re-syncing mechanism.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Apache Storm</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apache Storm is a distributed stream processor that further processes the messages coming from Kafka topics. It is common to call Storm a &#8220;Hadoop for real-time data.&#8221; This distributed database technology is scalable, fault-tolerant, and analytic.</span></p>
<h3><b>Apache NiFi</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For intuitive web-based interface that supports scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic, one can use Apache NiFi. It is also simpler to get quick results from NiFi than from Apache Storm.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15920" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/NiFi-interface-1024x635.png" alt="big data process" width="640" height="397" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/NiFi-interface-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/NiFi-interface-300x186.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/NiFi-interface-768x476.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/NiFi-interface-600x372.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/NiFi-interface-450x279.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/NiFi-interface-1000x620.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/NiFi-interface.png 1768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern big data technologies and tools are mature means for enterprise Big Data efforts, allowing to process up to hundreds of petabytes of data. Still, their efficiency relies on the system architecture that would use them, whether it is an ETL workload, stream processing, or analytical dashboards for decision-making. Thus, enterprises should to explore the existing open-source solutions first and avoid building their own systems from ground up at any cost — unless it is absolutely necessary. </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern businesses increasingly rely on data to succeed, taking on the “data-centric” tag. As large amounts of data allows companies and their products evolve quickly efficiently to address the demands of customers, the trend will continue to strengthen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, we created a brief guide about the types of data analysis that explains the 4 types of data analytics, what purpose they serve, and what technology and type of talent they rely on. The guide is also supplied with examples of data analytics from across industries for additional context.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start exploring the types of analytics below.</span></p>
<h2><b>Descriptive Analytics</b></h2>
<p><b>What is descriptive analytics:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a preparatory stage in data processing that summarises data from past periods to provide insights and prepare the gathered data for future analysis. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Descriptive Analytics Examples</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, a hotel chain would use descriptive analytics to determine the level of demand for new VIP suites in a hotel. Similarly, an insurance company can use descriptive data analytics to see what services are the most popular in a given season, while an online retailer can find out the least popular products from new arrivals.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Descriptive Analysis Steps</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determine business metrics against set goals and establish KPIs to monitor progress</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gather and prepare the data. When you finished gathering the right data from the enterprise systems, you need to use descriptive analytics techniques to prepare it (for example, deduplication — eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dedicated experts (data analytics, Business Intelligence experts) perform the analysis of the prepared data </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visualization/Presentation. The data is displayed to shareholders in various charts, graphs, narratives, or tables</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15860" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Laptop-with-Dashboard-Open-1024x729.jpg" alt="4 types of data analytics" width="640" height="456" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Laptop-with-Dashboard-Open-1024x729.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Laptop-with-Dashboard-Open-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Laptop-with-Dashboard-Open-768x547.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Laptop-with-Dashboard-Open-600x427.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Laptop-with-Dashboard-Open-450x321.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Laptop-with-Dashboard-Open-1000x712.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2><b>Diagnostic Analytics </b></h2>
<p><b>What is diagnostic analytics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a stage where the information gathered during descriptive analysis is compared against other metrics to find out why something happened. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Finding Anomalies with Diagnostic Analysis</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diagnostic analysis allows companies to identify anomalies, for examples sudden spikes in sales on a given day or torrential changes in website traffic. Here, data analysts need to single out the right data sets to help them explain the anomaly. Searching for the answer often involves drawing information from external sources. When the needed data is on the table, the analysts establish causal relationships and use different types of data analytics (probability theory, regression analysis, filtering, and other) to find the answer. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Diagnostic Analytics Examples</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With diagnostic analytics, a hotel chain would compare the demand for VIP suites in different regions or hotels in a region, while the insurance company would, for example, get insights into what age group uses dental treatment the most in the target area. Meanwhile, an online retail store might use diagnostic analytics to discern what regions ordered a particular product from new arrivals more.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Predictive Analytics</strong></h2>
<p><b>What is predictive analytics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a data analysis type that allows companies to forecast problems that might occur in future or a trend and how would be unfolding. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Predictive Analytics Examples</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this type of analysis, a hotel could predict how much a new promising guest service would bring in revenue in a given region. A retailer could use in-depth data on their customers and other metrics to forecast a reaction on a new store type. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predictive analysis involves advanced tools and technologies and should be based on a big amount of solid data (internal and external) to yield a reliable result. Importantly, achieving an effective forecast depends on a wide array of factors, including the level of volatility of the situation. Predictive analytics also require continuous involvement from the data science team.</span></p>
<p><b>Predictive Analytics Techniques</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistical analysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neural networks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data mining</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, predictive data analytics heavily rely on technologies like machine learning, as they can process large data sets quickly. Still, for the analysis to succeed, data science teams and software developers need to create predictive data algorithms for the business goal in question. This requires collaboration with key stakeholders and business analysts. Once again, the quality of the data for the analysis is critically important. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Prescriptive Analytics</strong></h2>
<p><b>What is prescriptive analytics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a data analysis type that uses advanced technology heavily to find the best solution based on data provided from predictive analytics. Thus, prescriptive analytics would determine what a company could do with a problem or trend foreseen by predictive analytics. Like predictive analytics, prescriptive analysis needs its own business logic and algorithms. As for prescriptive analytics techniques, machine learning is one of the most common.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Prescriptive Analytics Examples</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From one side, prescriptive analytics techniques can be used to gain highly rich insights in customer behaviour across industries. On the other, machine learning algorithms can be trained to analyse stocks markets and automate human decision making by presenting decisions based on large amounts internal and external data. In any case, prescriptive analytics are a costly investment: the investors need to be confident that the analysis yields substantial benefits. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Types of Data Analytics — Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information is one of the most valuable business assets of today. Various types of data analytics allow businesses to improve their operations and customer experiences, providing insights and a clearer picture on the business in general. Relying on extensive experience of top management and their employees, modern companies would mostly rely on descriptive and diagnostic analytics to aid human decision making in the following. Still, as the role of data only grows and the analysis tools evolve, companies that want to be ahead of competition will also use predictive and prescriptive analytics to stay ahead and automate a number of operations.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft has been offering </span></i><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/solutions/ai"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI-based software solutions</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so we have started a series of blog posts to shed a light on what AI is, its applications, as well as how to implement it successfully in the enterprise. The previous post was </span></i><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a case-driven guide to machine learning</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep learning is set to take us to a technologically advanced, automated future of self-driving cars and robotic assistants. However, what it is and how it works still remains a subject significantly more complex than most users imagine.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us, as we take a closer look at deep learning without going to the neighboring territories of mathematics and software engineering. </span></p>
<h3><b>What is deep learning</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning — a type of data analysis that uses self-learning algorithms to analyse big data, learn from it, and eventually solve a problem, provide insights, or predict an outcome. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, deep learning employs algorithms that are fundamentally more complex than those employed in machine learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These self-learning algorithms are called </span><b>deep neural networks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, they are built to mimic biological neural networks of animals and humans to solve problems and tackle tasks of greater complexity, like driving vehicles and providing security using face recognition systems.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4419" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_02-300x300.jpg" alt="Deep learning - neural networks" width="364" height="364" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_02-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_02-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_02.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_02-450x450.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do these neural networks succeed? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like human <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/sweeping-success-young-app-developers">neural networks</a>, deep neural networks are arranged in a hierarchical manner. More importantly, the layers of deep neural networks are also able to learn abstract features, allowing them to observe nuances in complex data blocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, artificial neurons can detect the smallest abstract details — patterns of low-level features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we take human face recognition as an example, a deep learning algorithm will not only be able to discern one face from another, but detect differences connected to the smallest details, like pores or wrinkles. This goes up to mid-level features like eye color, ear, and eyebrow shapes, and further on to high-level features, like discerning the differences in face shapes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, when it comes to the allocation of tasks in the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services/enterprise-development">enterprise of the future</a>, machine learning algorithms will make valuable predictions in different departments based on business data; while deep learning will drive autonomous corporate vehicles and provide security with face recognition systems.  </span></p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4420" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_03.jpg" alt="Deep neural networks" width="364" height="364" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_03.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_03-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_03-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_03-450x450.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" /></h3>
<h3><b>Deep learning subtypes and applications</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several subtypes of deep learning, and each of them tackles a different task. </span></p>
<p><b>Convolutional neural networks</b> <b>(CNNs)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are designed for computer vision tasks — acquiring, analysing, and understanding digital images to extract high-dimensional information to make a decision. CNNs can be used for video tracking, object recognition, motion estimation, and more.</span></p>
<p><b>Recurrent neural networks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are created with built-in memory, and are best suitable for language processing tasks, like spot-on translation from one language to another. </span></p>
<p><b>Q-learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a subtype of deep learning that is built on an action-value relation.  An artificial intelligence agent determines the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">value </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being in a specific state</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>taking an action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in that state. For example, it will determine the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">consequences</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the way it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">handles the controls of a car</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><b>turn or hit the brakes to avoid collision.</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4418" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_01.jpg" alt="Deep learning - subtypes and applications" width="364" height="364" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_01.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_01-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_01-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pic_01-450x450.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" /></p>
<p><b>Policy learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows the AI agent to learn an elaborately detailed set of instructions that shows the best possible action for a given state. This subtype of deep learning will be used in AI-based voice assistants on the front desks of enterprises.</span></p>
<p><b>Reinforcement learning. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A reinforcement learning agent has to decide how to act to perform a task through the process of trial and error in a dedicated training environment. Earlier this year, Google’s AI-enabled program AlphaGO defeated the champion in GO — an abstract game that is more complex than chess. This became possible through reinforcement learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even now, the promise of deep learning is grand — one should only remember the rigorous testing of Tesla’s self-driving cars. While consumers still have to wait—business doesn’t. Today, more and more enterprises are implementing deep and machine learning to gain a competitive edge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reasoning behind it is straightforward: in a data-driven corporate culture where you rely on big amounts of information, AI is a lifeline that helps enterprises make use of all their data quickly.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next post, we will explain how to successfully implement an AI-based solution in the enterprise.</span></i></p>
<p><b>Meanwhile, if you can’t postpone implementing an AI-based solution any longer, </b><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/contacts"><b>get in touch with us</b></a><b>. We will help you with it from algorithm to implementation.</b></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence (AI) <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/mobile-enterprise-trends-in-5-exciting-startups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has firmly settled in the headlines</a> of business publications and newsfeeds. Amazon went from machine learning (ML) algorithms that boost sales by improving recommendations to the quest of making the AI-powered Alexa speaker a ubiquitous device. Airbus is using artificial intelligence powered software to improve production with a self-learning algorithm that identifies patterns in production problems. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola is planning a location-sensitive vending machine with an assistant powered by artificial intelligence based technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list will continue to grow, and it will grow fast. Paired with Big Data, AI-based software solutions are bringing precise automation and valuable insights to the majority of industries and business departments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the definition of artificial intelligence remains vague and, in many cases, complex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Intellectsoft has been creating <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/solutions/ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI-based software solutions</a>, we are starting a series of posts about AI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This post will answer the following questions: What is artificial intelligence</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What is machine learning and what are its types? Finally, what are the three cornerstones of implementing machine learning algorithms?</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4386 " src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_01.jpg" alt="what is artificial intelligence" width="360" height="360" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_01.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_01-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_01-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_01-450x450.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></p>
<h2><b>What is Artificial Intelligence</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a broad sense, </span>artificial intelligence <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a field of study that uses a wide array of scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods to understand what is required for a machine to exhibit intelligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concurrently, the much talked about machine learning and deep learning are essentially self-learning algorithms of different complexity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are part of the field of study of AI, but referring to them as “AI” is not accurate. The field encapsulates too many complex concepts; assigning the term to each separately creates confusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is true for other general terms commonly used with self-learning algorithms — “software” and “technology.” These terms create further confusion by drawing associations with <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/services/enterprise-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">software development</a> and everything that can be called a physical or digital technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving AI out of the name won’t be accurate either. After all, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are autonomous, coming up with their own decisions based on Big Data. More so, deep learning essentially mimics the neural networks of a human brain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As machine learning, deep learning, and adjacent algorithms are commonly used in the context of IT, the most accurate way to encapsulate them in one term would be to call them </span><b>AI-based software solutions</b> <b>(or AI-based solutions)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This term covers all the self-learning algorithms <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/ai-enterprise-software-companies-benefit-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">applicable in the enterprise</a> without touching concepts like </span><b>Artificial Super Intelligence</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (think Skynet and Elon Musk’s presentations about dangerous robots) and questions like AI ethics and values learning problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, &#8220;machine learning software&#8221; has also gained traction in 2017; it is also correct, applying to software solutions driven by machine learning algorithms.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4388 " src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_03.jpg" alt="what is machine learning" width="360" height="360" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_03.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_03-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_03-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_03-450x450.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></p>
<h2><b>Machine Learning Definition and Types</b></h2>
<p><b>Machine learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a type of data analysis that uses self-learning algorithms to analyse vast amounts of data, learn from the data, and then present a solution to a problem, provide insight, or make a prediction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of machine learning algorithms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><b>supervised learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an algorithm runs on labeled data. This type is used to solve a problem or make a prediction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at an example:</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em> Your enterprise wants to use machine learning to check the validity of your top managers’ signatures on contracts to avoid fraud. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>You gather ten documents with signatures for each top manager (for a spot-on result, as every subsequent signature differs from the previous signatures and the ones that follow), label them with the corresponding names, and then run this data through a machine learning algorithm. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Having established the connection, the software that employs ML will analyze the contracts by itself, and let you know if someone tampered with a signature immediately.</em></span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><b>unsupervised learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an algorithm runs on unlabeled data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of ML is mostly used to derive insights by clustering data into groups by similarity and compressing it in size and dimensions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><a href="https://www.rtinsights.com/netflix-recommendations-machine-learning-algorithms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><b>Netflix</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses an unsupervised learning algorithm to deliver nuanced recommendations based on Big Data — what the viewers searched for, rated; the time, date, and device; as well as the browsing and scrolling behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, four-star Oscar movies will be side-to-side with two-star comedies in the “Recommended for You” section. Carlos Gomez-Uribe, VP of product innovation and personalization algorithms at Netflix, provides a spot-on explanation for the machine learning algorithm in a </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/08/qq_netflix-algorithm/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interview:</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>People rate movies like Schindler’s List high, as opposed to one of the silly comedies I watch, like Hot Tub Time Machine. If you give users recommendations that are all four- or five-star videos, that doesn’t mean they’ll actually want to watch that video on a Wednesday night after a long day at work. Viewing behavior is the most important data we have.</em></span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, unsupervised learning avoids the “intuition failure” (recommending a four-star movie on a page of other four-star movies), taking advantage of vast amounts of raw data, and allowing for valuable insights. Gomez-Uribe and his colleague Xavier Amatriain (engineering director at Netflix) wrote an </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2843948" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article on the topic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where they assert that machine learning algorithms save Netflix one billion dollars a year. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4387 " src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_02.jpg" alt="artificial intelligence definition" width="361" height="361" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_02.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_02-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_02-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Icon_02-450x450.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, what about custom machine learning algorithms?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s an array of common algorithms that can be applied to solve the majority of data problems. If no existing algorithm fits your problem, you can create a your own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you should consider is that the accuracy of the final result depends on the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effectiveness of the chosen algorithm;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How you apply it;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And how much useful data you have.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the three cornerstones that will kickstart a successful implementation of algorithm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope our post has helped you understand AI and ML better, and that your project will be on the lists of essential machine learning examples in the future.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next posts, we will look at deep learning and outline how to ensure an impactful and full-fledged implementation of AI-based solutions in the enterprise.</span></i></p>
<p><strong><i>If you can’t postpone the implementation of your machine learning software or other AI-based software, </i></strong><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/contacts"><b><i>get in touch with us</i></b></a><b><i>. We will help you create a comprehensive solution, from algorithm to implementation. </i></b></p>
