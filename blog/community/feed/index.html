								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern tech conferences begin with yoga sessions at the beach. Several years ago a start like this might have been common only to small to medium conferences, where ninety percent of participants are startups. Today, the trend has reached the most anticipated event in the user experience field — UXPA international 2018, which took place in Puerto Rico at Wyndham Rio Mar beach resort on 26-28 of June. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft flew to the picturesque lands of the island as well: Anna Iurchenko, the experience designer of Intellectsoft Augmented Reality Lab, gave two presentations (a rare case for the conference) alongside designers from tech giants like Google and other professionals in the field. The attendees, speakers, and other guests not only delivered many interesting, educational, and thought-provoking talks, but also helped UXPA carry its spirit and friendly mood into yet another successful event. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Most Popular UX Conference in the World</span></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5165" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/UXPA-OUTSIDE.jpg" alt="ux conference" width="650" height="434" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/UXPA-OUTSIDE.jpg 938w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/UXPA-OUTSIDE-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/UXPA-OUTSIDE-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/UXPA-OUTSIDE-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/UXPA-OUTSIDE-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The attendees of UXPA 2018 network on the hotel&#8217;s grounds.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual event is hosted by the namesake organization UXPA (User Experience Professionals Association), whose community enlists 2400 members in 59 chapters located around the globe. Since its inception in 1991, the organization had established itself as a major force in the field of UX. The main mission of UXPA has always remained unchanged: support people who design, evaluate, and research user experience of design of products and services. To add to that, UXPA publishes their findings in their two magazines — Usability Studies and User Experience Magazine. Still, UXPA International Conference has become the main means of fulfilling the association’s mission, becoming increasingly bigger and more popular year after year. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">UXPA Conference 2018 Goes to New Highs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gathering designers and design researches from tech giants and big-name companies, this year’s UXPA conference was here to prove and elevate its popularity one more time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the companies stressing the importance of user experience methodology, management, strategy, and principles across industries were Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Capital One, Uber, IBM, and Facebook. The speakers delivered an abundance of interesting talks connected to design in several categories: career development, design psychology, design innovation, interaction design, user experience tools, techniques, and best practices in the field; user experience strategy; and more. There were both advanced and entry level talks and panels, ranging from deep listening in user experience design research to web VR design to discussing the importance of academia-industry connection in the UX field. The workshops of UXPA had a similarly rich range. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5166" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Iurchenko-at-UXPA.jpg" alt="UXPA conference" width="651" height="464" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Iurchenko-at-UXPA.jpg 879w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Iurchenko-at-UXPA-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Iurchenko-at-UXPA-768x547.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Iurchenko-at-UXPA-600x427.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Iurchenko-at-UXPA-450x320.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Anna Iurchenko, the experience designer at our Augmented Reality Lab.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft’s presence was substantial, and came mainly in the success of Anna Iurchenko: her talk and poster presentation were picked from three hundred submissions, passing peer review and UXPA conference committee discussion stages. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How User Experience Saves Lives — Anna Iurchneko’s Talk</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before transitioning to Experience Designer at Intellectsoft AR Lab, Anna was the Lead UX designer at Stanfy, an innovative San Francisco startup known for their highly effective, elaborately designed products (Intellectsoft has acquired Stanfy in 2016). Anna has spent four years designing healthcare products whose user base exceeds four million people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna’s talk — “Changing Users Health Behavior Through Design” — concerned user experience research, flow, and design process as much as behavioral psychology. First, Anna briefly charted through the history of health behaviour theories. Having it mapped out, Anna concluded that the Fogg Behavior Model is the the most fitting means to form a habit in a healthcare product. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5167" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presentation.png" alt="user experience professionals association" width="649" height="415" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presentation.png 979w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presentation-300x192.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presentation-768x491.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presentation-600x384.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presentation-450x288.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Anna explains and illustrates the Fogg Model.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposed by Dr. BJ Fogg, the founder of the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford University, the model shows that three elements must converge at the same moment of time for a behavior to occur: motivation, ability, and trigger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After explaining the model, Anna quickly transitioned to showing an example where it was used. It was the product she worked on several years ago, Transplant Hero — an app that ensures that people who have a transplant organ stick to the rigorous meditation intake schedule. With the need for patients to take fifteen different medication four times a day — day and night — the project was incredibly challenging. It was the test for all the aspect of the field of UX, from user experience research and strategy to metrics and principles. More so, the user experience metrics the team she worked with gathered were not exactly re-affirming: among the 4 billion prescription given to patients worldwide, only half are taken correctly. To add to that, 15% of transplant patients have lost their lives because they forgot to take the medication on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did Anna and the designer team face the towering challenge? First and foremost, the performed a rigorous research. The team used the following user experience research methods in the process of creating Transplant Hero:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User experience surveys carried out face to face with patients</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Observations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design workshops</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the research and creation of a user experience strategy, the team decided that app should perform three key functions: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remind about taking medication at the right time — the app should provide smart guidance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be a game — the app should be a friend, not a doctor</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leverage positive aspects of social media, in a user experience design that excludes drama.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a series of discussions, the team outlined how this will work in detail, widening the scope of each function. Eventually the app’s functions were expanded to the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educate and become a friendly companion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set achievable goals to build confidence and skills in users</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celebrate progress and success</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show value early on</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leverage social media influence for positivity</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, Anna and the team weaved a common thread between all the functions — friendly, cartoon-like characters, each of whom represented a human organ or a medication. The characters were key to user experience, the design in general, and helped Transplant Hero achieve its goals. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5168" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-1024x589.png" alt="UXPA Conference 2018" width="704" height="405" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-1024x589.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-300x173.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-768x442.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-600x345.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-450x259.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presenation-Beginning-1000x575.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Presenation-Beginning.png 1088w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Anna gives the main talk. On the screen to the right is the heart character from Transplant Hero, a mobile aid for transplant patients that she helped create.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Positive” and “light-hearted” were common words in the team’s discussions. In the end, the app served one more key purpose besides from ensuring transplant patients take their medication: take as much stress as possible from taking medication and post-transplantation process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app proved impactful. According to studies that were carried out in Montefiore Medical Center (where the app was used), Transplant hero doubled the medication adherence rate among patients who used it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the way, Anna also shared examples of other works, including an app that helps to quit smoking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, Anna’s talk described how a relatively simple behavioral model, a comprehensive user experience research, and spot-on creative choices born in the process of team collaboration, among other things, can help designers face challenges in arguably the most demanding industries, which also has the highest stakes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna’s second appearance at UXPA was in form of a poster talk, which was dedicated solely to the Transplant Hero project. It was a shorter version of the mobile solution’s case study for those who missed the talk or hadn’t had a lot of time on their hands.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5169" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Poster.jpg" alt="uxpa international" width="501" height="375" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Poster.jpg 835w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Poster-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Poster-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Poster-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Anna-Poster-450x337.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Anna answers the questions about Transplant Hero in the process of the poster talk.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases, the reception was warm. The attendees thanked Anna for bringing up important questions, asked an abundance of questions after the main and poster talk, wanted to know more details, and voiced their excitement about the project. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts — Looking Back at UXPA 2018</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the scale and the apparent seriousness, the User Experience Association has managed to preserve the togetherness and friendliness commonly associated with small conferences, while also managing to grow and scale. Recalling her days at UXPA 2018, Anna said she was amazed to learn that some people attended it for ten years straight or more. The fact that hundreds of designers and design researchers anticipate it like the next comic movie was equally inspiring. Over the years, UXPA has managed to preserve its reputation — an event that gathers open-minded and friendly people who would eagerly share their experience with each other, who believe that design is highly important, and highly impactful when approached comprehensively. All for making better products for a better world, while becoming better themselves. What’s more amusing is that this locomotive of a UX conference doesn’t show any signs of stopping.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The profound humanitarian fallout of the COVID-19 continues to expand by the day. Governments have launched unprecedented public-health and economic responses. Companies have developed and implemented business continuity plans, security guidance, and, most importantly — seamless remote working conditions. In this article, we offer some of Intellectsoft’s latest insights of managing a team of remote developers during times like this.</p>
<h1><b>How To Manage Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h1>
<p>So here we are, living in a world where pandemic movies came to life. The number of ill people is rising, as well as the level of stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Since March 16, our employees have been working remotely. We have already faced all the possible difficulties on our way and learned how to tackle the main challenges to manage the working process smart and effectively. We are ready to spill the beans and share all the secrets of productive remote management.</p>
<p>To stop COVID-19, all the countries around the world are trying to minimize human interactions, resulting in <strong>a staggering number of employees learning how to work remotely</strong>. Even though the majority of software engineers are not new to work like this, it can still be quite a challenge to manage a team in such difficult times psychologically.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19392 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-scaled.jpg" alt="How To Manage Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>That is why in this article, we are going to shed light on ten tips to organize an effective working process with remote developers, taking into account both psychological pitfalls and practical hurdles to overcome.</p>
<h2><b>How to Manage a Team of Remote Developers Despite the Uncertainty</b></h2>
<p>First and foremost, you need to outline all the possible challenges your software development team may face when working from home. Usually, it boils down to three main challenges. These are communication problems and pitfalls, lack of well-functioned equipment, and the inability to manage productivity.</p>
<p>For this reason, before setting out the rules, guidelines, and software development team goals, make sure you did your best to eliminate or alleviate the possible struggles that may occur.</p>
<h2><b>10 Tips To Keep Your Developers Team Effective During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h2>
<p>Luckily, we have already examined the best cases of smart and efficient remote developers management and prepared a quick guide for you to follow. We have taken into consideration the main challenges that can be difficult to tackle and offering comprehensive solutions to the problem. Take a look and enjoy the tips that truly work.</p>
<h3><b>1. Secure a Well-Functioned Tech Facilities and Tools</b></h3>
<p>Firstly, you need some software that will unite all the working processes. To ensure productivity, you’d better have a look at <strong>various collaboration tools perfect for a software development team working remotely.</strong>  Such tools as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/ru/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jira</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/?&amp;aceid=&amp;adposition=&amp;adgroup=77960797405&amp;campaign=1495118561&amp;creative=389415003358&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=trello&amp;matchtype=e&amp;network=g&amp;placement=&amp;ds_kids=p48956357108&amp;ds_e=GOOGLE&amp;ds_eid=700000001557344&amp;ds_e1=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Iv0BRDaARIsAGTWD1u6J2htFRXh6wNFyzNse_aL_oTmPCvKEjPuVZYAT10fuV645yZsumIaAieOEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trello</a>, <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom</a> enable us to stay focused on daily tasks, plan and manage projects. Slack helps our team to stay connected all the time. It’s the place where we <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/remote-team-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainstorm</a> and solve current issues. And Zoom, as a perfect alternative to Skype, is a way more convenient tool to have video calls and screen sharing.</p>
<p>What is more, there are tons of <a href="https://brainhub.eu/blog/tools-for-remote-development-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity tools</a> that are both efficient and have friendly interfaces like Todoist, iDoneThis, and Atlassian Stash. With the help of such systems, it is much easier to have an overall picture needed when working remotely.</p>
<h3><b>2. Make Sure Your Staff Have Everything for Effective Work</b></h3>
<p>But for the obvious essentials like a well-function computer or a laptop and great Internet connection, one should think through all the possible hurdles on the way to a smooth remote working process. Ensure that you have <strong>a backup to the cloud in case there is any accidental deletion of valuable files. </strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, your workers need to have “<a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/secure-collaboration-remote-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">access</a> to servers, development environments, and shared code.” Otherwise, your software developers teams will just stumble upon inconveniences that could lower their productivity.</p>
<h3><b>3. Think Through Communication Channels</b></h3>
<p>Even though many people hate these real face-to-face meetings, during such gatherings, you can communicate fast, transmit your ideas fast, and, most importantly, solve the existing problems fast. When working with remote developers, it is vital to have <strong>regular video meetings.</strong> Not only will regular conferences reduce the problem with the lack of information, but they also help to unite workers and show they are all in this together.</p>

<h3><b>4. Help Your Workers With Self-Organization</b></h3>
<p>If you want your developers’ team to be productive, you need to show them the importance of <strong>self-organization and discipline</strong>. Teach them to stay online during the working day. What is more, be a great example and don’t bother them with work issues at weekends and when the working day has ended.</p>
<p>Explain that the remote work schedule is no different from work in the office, and this is actually the good news. The reason is simple: you work the same amount of time, but you don’t waste your time commuting, for instance. What is more, psychologically it is less stressful when you do your job within the agreed time period, having no put offs, and then just relax after the work is done.</p>
<h3><b>5. Set Software Development Team Roles and Responsibilities</b></h3>
<p>Make sure both formal and informal roles are distributed effectively so that each employee knows exactly what their responsibilities are. When working remotely, a team <strong>“can truly benefit from having informal roles like various kinds of leaders, idea generators, critics, and doers”</strong>, as it is the key to self-management.</p>
<p>Plus, it is worth mentioning that to maximize productivity, you’d better build small teams of <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/how-manage-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-8 people</a>. Such teams are more autonomous, take responsibility for their initiatives, and as a result, are more efficient. In case you’re developing a big project, you can always divide one team into sub-teams.</p>
<h3><b>6. Keep Everyone Updated</b></h3>
<p>When working together on one project, it is crucial that <strong>all the members are in the loop</strong>, especially in the case of remote developers. For this reason, once again, think through regular conference meetings to discuss the relevant issues. Knowing the status of other projects, or being aware of any changes in the company’s goals and objectives is all crucial to an employee working remotely. That is why ensure that nobody is missing out on anything.</p>
<h3><b>7. Encourage Open Conversation </b></h3>
<p>Let us face reality, COVID-19 is not the usual flu, and it has been a long time since the last serious pandemic. That is why all the people are feeling stressed, anxious, and some can even get depressed. An employer or HR manager encourages open conversation with your workers. Make sure you ask your workers how they feel.</p>
<p><strong>“It is <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/7-tips-for-working-fsuccessfully-managing-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">believed</a> that the main struggle remote workers face is the feeling of loneliness and isolation”.</strong> For this reason, it would be a great idea to offer an opportunity for an online session with the psychologist. After all, you are working with people, and their emotional and physical being is the main priority.</p>
<h3><b>8. Remind About Data Protection</b></h3>
<p>Ensure that your employees are informed about protecting data. Remind them that it isn’t advisable to transfer work data, materials, and emails to their personal devices without permission. In case they do not have any other choice but to work on their personal laptop or computer, make sure that they <strong>take all the necessary precautions</strong> like antivirus software or not letting the browsers save some work passwords, for instance.</p>
<p>What is more, you should ensure <a href="https://intersog.com/blog/software-teams/how-to-keep-your-remote-software-development-team-safe-and-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secure connections</a> with VPN, as well as adopt smart and secure cloud storage solutions.</p>

<h3><b>9. Trust Your Developers Team</b></h3>
<p>If you want to create a comfortable and efficient working environment, it is not about tracking and monitoring productivity all the time or comparing the performance. <strong>It is about believing in your team</strong>, talking to them, and taking an interest in what bothers them. After all, it does not matter whether you work from home or stay in the office. If a team achieves the required outcome, it means they are doing a great job.</p>
<h3><b>10. Goals Are the Priority, Not Activity</b></h3>
<p>According to Forbes contributor Donal Hatter, who specializes in sales and effective leadership, <strong>it is crucial to focus on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/05/30/top-15-tips-to-effectively-manage-remote-employees/#62a35f47503c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">objectives</a> when working with a remote team.</strong> He believes that productivity boils down to the results having been achieved, rather than what is being done. For this reason, the last tip is to focus on the goals you want to achieve with your team and work towards them no matter the obstacles.</p>
<h1><b>How to Motivate and Manage Remote Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis </b></h1>
<p>Believe it or not, humanity has always been facing this or that crisis. However, the main advantage of the human race is the ability to adapt to any kind of change or environment. That is why getting used to working remotely is also just a matter of time and, in fact, is the future of work.</p>
<p>Embrace such an opportunity to build strong functionality even when your employees are not under control in the office. Be there for them, be consistent, and set clear goals. Use all the abundance of online tools to do work as productive as offline, or even better as <a href="https://www.inc.com/stephen-denny/3-ways-to-inspire-innovation-from-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working remotely</a> today may be the key to innovation tomorrow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this rapidly changing global business and humanity environment — where cost is a true strategic differentiator — Intellectsoft findings provide an inside look at the practices and trends currently shaping the future of enterprises.</p>
<p><b>In brief:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</li>
<li>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results,&#8221; — Gartner.</li>
<li>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses, including collaborative models, dedicated teams, and remote work.</li>
</ol>
<h1>1. A challenging landscape</h1>
<p>As a typical “black swan” event, COVID-19 took the world by complete surprise. This newly identified coronavirus was first seen in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, on December 31, 2019. As we almost enter April 2020, the virus has infected over 700,000 people, led to more than 30,000 deaths, and has spread to more than 200 countries.</p>
<p>The focus of most businesses is now on protecting employees, understanding the risks to their business, and managing the supply chain disruptions caused by the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. The full impact of this epidemic on businesses is still unknown. However, one thing is certain:</p>
<blockquote><p>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</p></blockquote>
<p>Optimizing costs is a perennial, continuous cross-enterprise effort organizations take into consideration now more than ever. <a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/sales-service/documents/trends/driving-cost-optimization-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost optimization</a> is a critical imperative for any functional leader, but its execution and impact reach far beyond the limits of any single functional area.</p>
<p><b>Cost optimization should not be confused with budget reductions. </b>When undertaking budget reductions, functional leaders — be they marketing leads, supply chain managers, business unit directors or technology team leaders — are often asked only to hit budget reduction targets within their own departments. While a more holistic, enterprise wide approach may be beneficial, the ability of functional leaders to impact areas outside their control is often limited.</p>
<p>Organizations should approach cost optimization as an expansive effort that can have both immediate and long-term significance for business performance. To truly serve the enterprise, cost optimization demands a mix of improvements that touch every part of the enterprise.</p>
<h1>2. Under-digitized businesses are hard-hit</h1>
<p>Businesses that are currently struggling for profitability — those with low or unstable cash reserves — are particularly vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/infrastructure-operations-cloud-germany/featured-topics/cost-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner Predicts</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, even businesses that appear to be in good financial shape may not be immune, depending on how the situation progresses. Sectors such as tourism, hospitality, entertainment and air transportation have been particularly hard-hit in the short term.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19345 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg" alt="industries that suffer the most" width="1235" height="596" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-300x145.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1024x494.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-768x371.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-600x290.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-450x217.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1000x483.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>Businesses in consumer goods and retail may also be at higher- than-normal financial risk, especially those in seasonal businesses where demand may be lost (as opposed to shifted), such as such perishable consumer goods and seasonal apparel. Even commodity-oriented industries, such as metals and mining or oil and gas, are exposed as global demand shifts and pricing fluctuates.</p>
<h1>3. Building blocks for change: cost optimization initiatives</h1>
<p>Given the importance of managing cash flows in times like this, companies should immediately develop a <b>plan for cost optimization as part of their overall business risk and </b><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/business-continuity-efforts-in-response-to-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>continuity plans</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<p>In doing so, it is essential to take a full ecosystem perspective, as the approaches you take to manage cash will have implications for not only your business but also for your customers.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19351 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization.jpg" alt="IT cost optimization pic" width="1235" height="887" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-300x215.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1024x735.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-768x552.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-600x431.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-450x323.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1000x718.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>Borrowing from the lessons learned from the SARS outbreak in 2003, the 2008 recession and credit crunch, and the last black swan event to significantly impact global economy — the Japanese earthquake of 2011 — we see the following practices and strategies as worth considering today.</p>
<p>Among them: ensuring your own financing remains viable, focusing on the cash-to-cash conversion cycle, thinking like a CFO, revisiting your variable costs and capital investment plans, extending payables, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Shared services, business process outsourcing, </b><a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/eventassets/en/conferences/dci9/documents/gartner-infrastructure-operations-cloud-india-cost-optimization-roadmap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>automation of IT operations</b></a> — all these components offer considerable cost saving opportunities. Enterprise cost optimization priorities — to preserve revenue, continue to innovate and keep the best staff — often conflict with the cost reduction priorities of functional leaders, which are to reduce costs quickly with as little disruption as possible.</p>
<h1>4. Five areas of focus for the enterprise</h1>
<p>While there is a great amount of functional variability in how leaders approach cost optimization, five areas of focus allow leaders in various roles and business units to pursue beneficial optimization (see the figure mentioned below).</p>
<h2>1) Benchmark to get a baseline</h2>
<p>The use of comparative metrics is a key aspect of any effective cost optimization campaign. <b>Benchmarks help leaders analyze their environments to discover what resources and initiatives may require additional funding or optimization.</b></p>
<p>Benchmarks also showcase areas of strategic investment. But care is required, as benchmarks can easily be misused.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19347 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg" alt="cost optimization across enterprise" width="1235" height="957" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1024x793.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-768x595.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-600x465.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-450x349.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1000x775.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<h2>2) Identify critical points in the budget to shield</h2>
<p>To bring more clarity to the optimization decision-making process, companies should identify:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">the potential financial benefit;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business impact;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business risk;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">time requirement of candidate cost optimization projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of impact, the effectiveness of the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Images/infographics/services/gx-deloitte-global-cost-management-infographic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost optimization initiative</a> is partly contingent on whether business unit leaders and their staff are capable of changing and adapting to new approaches and processes.</p>
<p>For example, optimization may involve frontline systems and tool automation as part of their business processes. What does this adaptation mean when leaders consider implementation and training timeframes?</p>
<p>To gain CEO or CFO approval for an initiative, leaders can describe a business case showing how the <b>cost optimization initiative will improve such criteria as:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Business processes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Time-to-market.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The like, as opposed to continuing with the status quo.</li>
</ol>
<p>These criteria points offer a suitable framework for prioritizing which line items are worth preserving, and which projects are worth supporting.</p>
<h2>3) Identify noncritical points to eliminate</h2>
<p>Just as crucial to the decision-making process is the identification of aspects of the business that can be eliminated or reduced. These changes will be primarily quantifiable as reductions in expense, but, again, leaders should consider the significance of each point to the business. An enterprise&#8217;s position within the growth model — growing, mature or declining — serves as an initial driver for identifying and prioritizing cost optimization opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Growing companies have a higher tendency to <b>standardize and simplify IT- enabled capabilities in order to optimize costs</b> and meet business goals for matching service levels to customer demand.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Mature enterprises typically respond to cost optimization goals with investment-based programs. </b>These programs aim to automate or utilize capabilities at lower capacity costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4) Determine cost optimization approach</h2>
<p>Several options exist for optimization, including reduction of costs, reduction of demand, and a balance of short- and long-term initiatives.</p>
<p>Some categories of optimization functions include:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Instituting emergency cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Applying selective cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Preserving costs and business value.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing costs for added business value.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5) Communicate plans to stakeholders and lead the organization through the change</h2>
<p>The leader of a cost optimization program will be in constant contact with all business areas. Communication of best practices should always include details of the practice and expected outcomes.</p>
<p>Leaders can also offer a list of alternative options that were considered, along with detailed explanations outlining why the alternative options were not selected.</p>
<h1>5. Accelerating through cost-efficient remote work</h1>
<p>A virtual remote workforce enables organizations to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce costs.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Drive growth and better serve customers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increase business productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Attract top talent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only remote work enables organizations to shift labor costs to lower cost resources, cut travel and expense budgets, and reduce fixed facility costs, but also a virtual workforce gives organizations a greater degree of flexibility to take advantage of lower cost labor regardless of location — and engage workers only when and where the business needs. For example, many workers sourced from outlying areas and offshore locations, such as Eastern Europe have significantly lower wages than similarly qualified resources.</p>
<p>From Google to Ford, companies around the globe are telling staff to work from home in a bid to stem the spread of pandemic. Such remote working at scale is unprecedented and will leave a lasting impression on the way people live and work for many years to come. What companies need in uncertain times is a collaborative mindset and the ability to map and analyze the value created deep within employee networks.</p>
<h1>6. Collaborative models and dedicated teams value</h1>
<p>Although collaboration is one of the most crucial components of modern businesses, most companies still do not know how to get the most out of it. Here are some of the <b>collaborative models tactics we apply here, at Intellectsoft:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The team members from different time zones are not assigned for one micro task.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Stories are organized between each other to ensure “rolling style” execution.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">All developers work shifted hours to ensure the best possible communications.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Work time designed so that all teams have 2 hours of overlap with regular PST work time.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Overlaps are used for daily scrums, any meetings and informal collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19346" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg" alt="distributed teams" width="1235" height="833" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-300x202.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-768x518.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-600x405.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-450x304.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1000x674.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>What companies need in a collaborative age is the ability to map and analyze the value created within employee networks. These networks should focus on both — individual and organizational effectiveness and on the value the interactions between employees and companies are created.</p>
<p>To make these interactions more useful, executives must reorient them toward the revenue and productivity benefits that collaborative models generate, the costs such interactions impose, and opportunities to improve connectivity at the points that create the greatest economic value.</p>
<h3>Dedicated Teams As More Cost-Effective Approach for Under-Digitized Businesses</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/dedicated-development-team-reimagined-and-improved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedicated team model</a> aims to provide a client with the right developers regardless of wherever the developers and the client are, and negotiate a mode of cooperation: nearshore (in close proximity to the client), onshore (on the client’s premises), or offshore (remotely).</p>
<p>Moreover, dedicated teams are known for their flexibility, niche skills, high scaling velocity, and high loyalty. As dedicated teams offer immense flexibility, the client has a lot of space to be efficient with their budget. The key industries that look for dedicated team approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthcare</a> (among them a lot of pharmaceutical companies);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/hospitality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel &amp; hospitality</a>;</li>

<h1>7. Beyond pandemic: risks and security</h1>
<p>For some organizations, survival is the only way of implementing things today. Others are crawling through the fog of uncertainty, guessing what’s next, where should be the next turn, when things get back to normal. The question is, what will new normal look like?</p>
<p>No one can answer this question for sure now. But what we believe we can state is that the new normal is already here. The pandemic has made it harder for companies to maintain risks and so — the security and stability of their operations and even survival mode. But new tactics can help leaders to safeguard their people and organizations.</p>
<p>We, at Intellectsoft, empower companies and their workforces with digital transformation services and approaches to help them survive during these times. Are you and your organization looking for it?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">We are executing against one the hardest times of our lives. Businesses are rapidly assessing fast-changing developments and the implications for their organizations. With crises like COVID-19, the time to act is now. The creation of elastic workplaces, efficient BCPs, and distributed workforces might be an answer to uncertain times and can help employees serve customers better while ensuring business continuity.</p>

<p>Main points:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Uncertain times: chaos or inevitable opportunism.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">How to act now: an elastic digital workplace and business flexibility.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed agile teams: a new way to deliver at scale.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking one step ahead.</li>
</ol>
<h2>1.  Uncertain times: chaos or inevitable opportunism</h2>
<p>Businesses worldwide have been reacting to the recent humanitarian and societal crisis that is forever going down in history as COVID-19. Today, we already witness an incredible power of the pandemic: disrupted workforces, supply chains, worldwide economic activity, and more to come in months. But what is it really: chaos or new opportunities for organizations to become more flexible and improve their business continuity management plans?</p>
<p>The reality is that every crisis or disaster sooner or later has both immediate and long-term implications of how businesses operate and impact society. So, it is with a sense of urgency that organizations should refer to their decades-long <b>IT business continuity plans</b><b> to ensure their operational and strategic resilience and agility.</b></p>
<p>Leaders (and not only them) are making rapid, highly-informed decisions. They should take immediate action to protect and support their workforce and ensure that all business operations continue in order to help business and societal continuities. Here are some of the most crucial components of how to behave today to safeguard the antifragility of your organization.</p>
<h2>2. IT Business <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;it business continuity plan&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:3700253},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">Continuity Plan</span>: Elastic Workplace and Business Flexibility</h2>
<p>The transition to remote work during coronavirus and distributed teams is accelerating daily. Tools are getting better. More companies embrace the benefits of their employees not being bound to a specific remote workplace on the scale of cities, countries, and even continents. Current disruptions to the workforce (as a result of remote working) requires workplace elasticity and business processes flexibility.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19200" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-scaled.jpg" alt="remote work from home" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<h3><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;it business continuity and disaster recovery&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:3700253},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">IT business continuity and disaster recovery</span></h3>
<p>To minimize business disruption and protect employees from consequences of threats, organizations should have not only a profound pandemic plan for business continuity but also be able to emerge from one of the most surreal moments of the recent memory.</p>
<p>Here are the <b>three most essential foundations leaders should pay attention to</b> today:</p>
<p>1. Empowering workforce and building a digital workplace</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>A</b><b>nalyze your current technology capabilities</b>, including a communications plan and support structure. It’s essential to keep leadership and employees aware of current fundamental changes;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Examine your ability to scale out internally.</b> Make sure that digital workplaces enable your people to work remotely through digital collaboration tools;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Start cultivating a digital culture and shifting to the mindset of collaboration.</b> Undoubtedly, your employees will require additional skills around the new way of working. Building the necessary skill set and remote workplace of trust can help employees serve customers better while ensuring business continuity.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Serving your customers’ core needs</p>
<p>Businesses adapt to serve customers through uncertainty. This, of course, means organizations are increasingly thinking out of the box to find creative ways to continue working with clients smoothly.</p>
<p>Highly extendable workplace environments allow organizations <b>to adapt to changing business needs based on global conditions.</b> Moreover, being extremely transparent in communication, operations, and engagements — is key to a successful transition from unpredictability to trusted relationships.</p>
<p>3. Establishing business continuity planning steps</p>
<p>While no systems can perfectly anticipate every contingency, ensuring that all business units are supported, informed, and protected as much as possible, can greatly untie your hands to develop new business processes. This means continuing to work while adapting to the new IT business continuity plan, ways of collaborating, and decision-making. But what is more important — to conduct additional disaster testing scenarios in parallel with operational work.</p>
<h3>Six steps for businesses’ quick reaction</h3>
<p>Today enterprises recognize the need to respond effectively to disruptions caused by factors outside their control. By following these steps for quick workplace adaptation and reaction to risks, companies can highly minimize the disruptions and inefficiencies in their operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Workplace adaptation to disruptions in 2020</b></p>

<h2>3. Distributed Agile Teams: a New Way to Deliver at Scale</h2>
<p>At Intellectsoft, we have worked with distributed teams for many years now. Lowering costs while increasing the pace of business — is no easy task. But it seems to be quite effective and allows for even greater potential benefits if implemented correctly.</p>
<p>Distributed agile teams require more communication and touchpoints. On the other hand, they can bring productivity and speed traditional teams simply cannot. Moreover, communication tools, project management approaches, and planning processes are improving all the time, leaving more space for collaboration and consistency.</p>
<p>Despite being thousands of kilometers apart, every employee interacts with the same board, is able to track the overall progress, and share lessons learned. During turbulent times like today’s one, it is just one of a few reliable ways your company can continually improve the work in a long-term perspective and improve business continuity strategy for the years to come.</p>

<h2>4. Thinking One Step Ahead</h2>
<p>The threats like COVID-19 will fundamentally change the way we work and engage. Leaders should develop a comprehensive BCP and new scenarios for its implementations, paying great attention to those basic steps we describe in this article.</p>
<p>The most important thing to recognize about coronavirus business impact is that operations cannot be considered to be business as usual (BAU) but must become business as survival (BAS).</p>
<p>To achieve the necessary resilience, leadership and С-level should clearly identify what businesses and operational processes in the organization are crucial to operating the core functions, and what — are not.</p>
<p>As the situation keeps developing, we will update our materials, so please check back regularly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><i>In the era of connected enterprises and total digitalization, finding a balance between optimizing productivity and innovating has never been simpler, yet more difficult, than ever before. </i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial intelligence</a>, machine learning, the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/internet-of-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet of Things</a>, automation, and <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other technologies</a> bring us more and more new types of data. On the one hand, it’s good to have a space for maneuvers. However, on the other hand, many senior executives remain less prepared than they think they are. Navigating the <strong>Fourth Industrial Revolution not only changes the way we think but also impacts how we learn and work using data</strong> to create value from the findings obtained through advanced technologies.</p>
<h2>An amalgam of opportunity and ambiguity</h2>
<p>According to a recent Deloitte Global <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/tr/Documents/manufacturing/Industry4-0_Are-you-ready_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a>, 72% of C-level executives across 19 countries (from the Americas, Asia, and Europe, and came from all major industry sectors) are <strong>ready to adopt and effectively use smart and autonomous technologies</strong> within their organizations.</p>
<p>43% of them consider a lack of internal alignment about which strategies to follow, as the most significant challenge their organizations face as they seek to adopt new technologies and applications. Intellectsoft’s experts have created unique infographics to shed some light on the most vital aspects and challenges the concept of Industry 4.0 owns today.</p>

<h2>What’s next? A New Lens of Innovation or Another Revolution</h2>
<p>When it comes to an impact Industry 4.0 will have on organizations and, most importantly, on the workforce, many questions arise. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/tr/Documents/manufacturing/Industry4-0_Are-you-ready_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22% of executives</a> surveyed believe that the new industrial revolution will have a significant effect on their companies. Another question — what kind of effect it will be.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Industry 4.0 is bringing changes to every geography and solution. Yet many executives still do not express the urgency of tackling the challenge of using the full potential of smart technologies to enable digital-physical integration. It is evident that the old way of doing things isn’t enough anymore, but many executives continue to focus on traditional business operations.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good beginning makes the good ending, so it goes without saying that choosing a system and style of management smart is the key to success when developing software. These days there are tons of approaches each having its pluses and minuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential to choose the smart strategy at the very beginning as well as defining your goals, objectives, budget and deadlines. That is why, we have investigated the issue to provide you with the ultimate guide on what methodology to use.</span></p>
<h2>History of Software Development Methodologies</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all began in 1950s and keeps on evolving, new approaches appearing until today. To put it shortly, throughout every decade, a particular methodology was supposed to best suit the needs of the time and perfect apt to solve the problems of the then days. Every new system was meant to make the development more productive and boost the desired results.</span></p>
<h2>Types of Software Development Methodologies</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what is the software development procedure all about? It has to do with dividing the working process into various stages, as well as delegating various task among different employees. What is more, it presupposes taking some specific approach to organizing and optimizing the whole development process and managing the team work. That is why, there are various types of methodologies aimed at improving SDLC. So here are the top ones we are going to examine.</span></p>
<h3>Software Development Methodologies List</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the list below we have presented 12 most common methodologies, the gist of every approach, their advantages and disadvantages.</span></p>
<h4>1. Agile Development Methodology</h4>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-17966 size-medium" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Agile-Development-Methodology-300x148.png" alt="Agile Development Methodology" width="300" height="148" /></p>
<p><strong>Gist:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The main focus of this methodology is the project/product itself. That is why, it presupposes various constant alterations based on users and customers feedback, as well as internal changes related to the work of engineers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile software development methodology </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is free of rigid frameworks on the one hand. While, on the other hand, the working process is divided into short time boxes, thus offering the real results and feedbacks truly fast.</span></p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems are fixed at the early stage, so the quality of the final product is often top-notch.</span></p>
<p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It is easy to get off track with all the constant changes and amendments aimed at improving the product.</span></p>
<h4>2. Waterfall Development Methodology</h4>
<p><b>Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The absolute opposite to the previous approach, this methodology is strict and linear. A new stage can only be started if the previous one is completed. In other words, each phase gradually flows into the next one. What is more, there is no going back to the previous stage. This approach is easy to understand as it presupposes a strict sequence of completed tasks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waterfall methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is often regarded as a classic representation of software development.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is simple, functional, gradual and analytical.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Works good with exact requirements and needs only. Weak for long or ongoing projects.</span></b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17967 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Waterfall-Development-Methodology.png" alt="Waterfall Development Methodology" width="604" height="245" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Waterfall-Development-Methodology.png 604w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Waterfall-Development-Methodology-300x122.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Waterfall-Development-Methodology-600x243.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Waterfall-Development-Methodology-450x183.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p>
<h4>3. <b>Extreme Programming</b></h4>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-17968" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-300x200.png" alt="Extreme Programming" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-300x200.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-768x512.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-600x400.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-450x300.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-1000x667.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming.png 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><b>Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect approach for unstable projects, as it implies involving the customer as much as possible. What is more, it presupposes considerable flexibility. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extreme programming methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is believed to boost the quality of software owing to its ability to adapt to dynamic changing demands. In addition to that, constant feedback and communication is the key to efficient and happy team environment.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significant customer involvement results in high quality products. Immediate feedback and courage to take difficult decisions.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiency is much dependent on the people involved. Vague and unknown future results.</span></p>
<h4><b>4. Lean Development</b></h4>
<p><b><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-17969" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-300x210.jpg" alt=" Lean Development" width="300" height="210" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-1024x718.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-1536x1077.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-600x421.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-450x315.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-1000x701.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Value for the client is the essential core element the whole approach revolves around. If something is worth, it should be done immediately; if not, it should be removed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean development methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focuses a lot on losses reduction. That is why, the whole project is examined significantly beforehand to eliminate any wasted time or money. As value is the core component, feedback plays the crucial role itself, so that the actions are taken fast.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect for low-budget project and rigid time limitations.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Success is much dependent on the working capacity of a team. Too much of a flexibility can lead to loss of a focus.</span></p>
<h4>5. Prototype Model</h4>
<p><b><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-17970" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Prototype-Model--293x300.png" alt=" Prototype Model" width="293" height="300" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Prototype-Model--293x300.png 293w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Prototype-Model--768x787.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Prototype-Model--600x615.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Prototype-Model--439x450.png 439w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Prototype-Model-.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px" />Gist:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Based on the waterfall approach and having a significant focus on customer feedback. There are some initial requirements, developers provide samples, and only after customers evaluate the functionality of samples, the final development begins. The gist of this method lies in the name itself &#8211; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prototype methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In other words, before getting down to business, there will be painstaking research and prototyping to avoid unnecessary risks.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased chances of top quality functionality and low risks of failure.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possible budget increase, as the management cost may go beyond the money limit. Too much of client involvement can affect the process by slowing it down.</span></p>
<h4>6. <b>Dynamic Systems Model</b></h4>
<p><b><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-17971" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dynamic-Systems-Model-280x300.jpg" alt="Dynamic Systems Model" width="280" height="300" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dynamic-Systems-Model-280x300.jpg 280w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dynamic-Systems-Model-600x643.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dynamic-Systems-Model-420x450.jpg 420w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dynamic-Systems-Model.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" />Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two main focuses: strict time frame and assigned budget. The idea is to manage to provide a successful and effective software within a particular time limit and not exceeding costs. Users involvement is of high importance as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamic systems model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presupposes continuous feedback to deliver maximum functionality within the agreed requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great communication between developers and users resulting in reaching the needed functionality as fast as possible.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs are quite considerable. The approach will not fit and meet the needs of a small organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>7. <b>Feature Driven Development</b></h4>
<p><b>Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Features are regarded as sort of users feedback. Planning, designing and building is all feature-based. This approach involves iterations to boost functionality and deal with varied complexities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feature driven development </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aims at organizing the work of a large number of teams within a big organization.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great dealing with huge projects. The pre-set standards simplify the developing procedure. Enables any developer with appropriate experience and expertise handle the tasks.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannot be applied by small organization. Needs leading developers to monitor the process. Difficult to guarantee the strict deadline.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17972" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Driven-Development-.jpg" alt="Feature Driven Development" width="988" height="524" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Driven-Development-.jpg 988w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Driven-Development--300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Driven-Development--768x407.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Driven-Development--600x318.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Driven-Development--450x239.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px" /></p>
<h4>8. <b>Rational Unified Process</b></h4>
<p><b>Gist:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The idea of this approach lies in having four stages of developing process. ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During each of the phases, all six core development disciplines take place &#8211; business modelling, requirements, analysis and design, implementation, testing and deployment’, according to study.com. The main focus of this methodology is craft an effective software of high quality without expanding the budget and missing the time frame.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reliable and strict documentation. Risks avoidance taking into consideration clients evolving needs.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considerably expert developer needed. May be too difficult to make head or tail of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rational unified process model.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17973" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Rational-Unified-Process.jpg" alt="Rational Unified Process" width="740" height="387" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Rational-Unified-Process.jpg 740w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Rational-Unified-Process-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Rational-Unified-Process-600x314.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Rational-Unified-Process-450x235.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></p>
<h4>9. <b>Spiral Model</b></h4>
<p><b><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-17974" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-300x250.png" alt="Spiral Model" width="300" height="250" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-300x250.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-1024x853.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-768x640.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-600x500.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-450x375.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-1000x833.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main idea is to eliminate the risks at the early stage of the project. The developing procedure goes from smaller level to the big ones gradually. This approach combines waterfall ideas with iterations. Each stage involves setting the goals and receiving feedback from a client. Moving from one phase to another in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">spiral model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implies completing and removing the risks before moving forward.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Process of estimating the costs is easy. Iterations help to manage the risks. There is a system of developing procedure, thus progress is achieved fast.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danger of failing to meet the agreed budget and time limit. Not suitable for small organizations and projects.</span></p>
<h4>10. <b>Joint Application Development</b></h4>
<p><b>Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach implies significant interaction between users, designers and developers. There are workshop sessions to facilitate and increase the developing process. During the session the following people are involved: a facilitator, end users, developers, observers, mediators and experts. What is more, in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">joint application development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there is a considerable focus on eliminating errors at the early stage, thus saving the expenses needed to correct the mistakes later on.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valuable info is achieved within a short time period. Immediate elimination of errors and resolving the differences.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can be quite time and energy consuming when it comes to planning. Requires significant budget. Needs highly experienced and expert professionals.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17975" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Joint-Application-Development.jpg" alt="Joint Application Development" width="988" height="524" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Joint-Application-Development.jpg 988w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Joint-Application-Development-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Joint-Application-Development-768x407.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Joint-Application-Development-600x318.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Joint-Application-Development-450x239.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px" /></p>
<h4>11. <b>Scrum Development</b></h4>
<p><b>Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to understand and effective when it comes to achieving results. The working process is divided into sprints. All the assignments for each sprint are set beforehand and are then discussed after this time period. Thanks to this approach, it is easy to get response to emerging problems early, and as a result solve them immediately. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scrum development methodology </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is by far the most flexible. For this reason, it easily deals with projects having changing requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is responsible for decision-making. Light control goes together with constant updating that keeps all of the team always on guard.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs needed can often be uncertain. Big projects cannot be managed with this approach. Only expert professionals can be involved, with no beginners.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17976" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Development.png" alt="Scrum Development" width="606" height="312" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Development.png 606w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Development-300x154.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Development-600x309.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Development-450x232.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px" /></p>
<h4>12. <b>Rapid Application Development</b></h4>
<p><b>Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clear from its name that the main goal of this approach is to achieve fast results. To do so it uses the assistance of other development methodologies. It focuses on fast prototype releases and iterations. As a result, the quick feedback is received, errors are eliminated and the desired results are reached. It is as flexible and adaptable as possible. The main focus is to adjust, so that the software is crafted functional and effective fast. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapid application development methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes 5 stages: analysis and quick design, prototype cycles, testing and implementation.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Client is encouraged to take fast reviews. Customers provide constant feedback for improvement.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not suitable for small projects. Highly expert employees are required. Too much dependant on team performance.</span></p>
<h2><b>Final words</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reach the desired results throughout the developing procedure it is essential to choose a suitable and appropriate approach first. Don’t hesitate to dedicate time and energy to define your goals and objectives, estimate your budget and set the time limits. It will help you understand which method to turn to if you want to succeed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that nothing works 100%. Every system has its benefits and drawbacks that need to be taken into consideration. For this reason, be careful and scrutinize each and every methodology before selecting one. Hope this article was of great help and now you feel more confident what type of approach will be just right for your team. </span></p>

<h3><b>Reasons to choose Ukraine for IT outsourcing</b></h3>
<p><b>1 — Extensive talent pool</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A vast talent pool is a major reason why software development outsourcing is booming in Ukraine. After the U.S., India, and Russia, Ukraine has the highest number of IT employees. In 2018, there were approximately 160,000 tech employees in the Ukrainian IT market. What’s more, the software developers pool in Ukraine is expected to cross the 200,000 mark in the coming years. According to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">SkillValue</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ukraine holds the eight spot on the list of the world’s top countries with highly skilled programmers, with an average score index of 91.26%.</span></p>

<p><b>2</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — </span><b>Attractive rates</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine is one of the most cost-effective IT outsourcing countries in the world across different software development categories. Compared to the neighboring countries like Poland, Belarus, and the Czech Republic, Ukraine offers more affordable outsourcing rates and a more diverse tech talent pool. If you want to hire a highly skilled software developer while saving a significant amount in development costs, Ukraine is a great choice. Ukrainian developers charge between $25-$50 whereas developers with the same skill sets in North America or Western Europe with will cost a project at least $100 per hour.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average hourly rate of Ukraine compared with other countries (Source: Clutch.co)</span></i></p>
<p><b>3 — Convenient time zone</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine&#8217;s time zone is one to two hours ahead of most European countries. This makes Ukraine a convenient destination for nearshoring as well as offshoring. European clients can work and communicate comfortably with Ukrainian developers due to insignificant time differences. If the client company is located in the U.S., Canada, or Australia, they can still get in touch with the developers without any impact on their own working schedule. Simply put, Ukraine’s location allows for better monitoring and easy project communication and control as compared to other outsourcing destinations like India, the Philippines, or Vietnam.</span></p>
<p><b>4 — English proficiency</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">English is not widely used in Ukraine, but many people are fluent in it, and the number only keeps increasing. Approximately 80 percent of software developers in Ukraine have an Intermediate or higher level of English. Also, it is worth mentioning that the vast majority of software development companies in Ukraine offer free in-house English lessons that help their employees improve their English skills and vocabulary on a regular basis. So, the level of English of Ukrainian developers lifts the language barrier and enables them to work on any international project. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17498" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/English-proficiency-of-Ukrainian-Developersukrainian-developers.png" alt="English proficiency of Ukrainian Developers" width="819" height="375" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/English-proficiency-of-Ukrainian-Developersukrainian-developers.png 819w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/English-proficiency-of-Ukrainian-Developersukrainian-developers-300x137.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/English-proficiency-of-Ukrainian-Developersukrainian-developers-768x352.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/English-proficiency-of-Ukrainian-Developersukrainian-developers-600x275.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/English-proficiency-of-Ukrainian-Developersukrainian-developers-450x206.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></span></p>

<p><b>5 — Education</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, over 36,000 students graduate from local universities in Ukraine with IT related degrees.

<h2><b>10 Steps to Hire Top Software Developers in Ukraine</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following are the 10 steps that should be performed to hire top Ukrainian software developers. If you have a big project or plan to scale, it is better to delegate the hiring duties entirely to a trustworthy outsourcing partner.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 1 – Select a company</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a primary analysis, and then narrow down your list to 2-3 options. Select a company based on client reviews and what your partners/associates have to say. Top managers usually have many connections and can easily acquire an informative overview on a range of potential IT partners. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 2 – Inquire about the chosen vendor</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the commencement of communication, it is important to find out as much as possible about your vendor. This includes inquiring about the vendor’s how many years the vendor has been operating in the industry, pricing, procedure for candidate selection, skills, etc. If several vendors fit your initial requirements, find out the information regarding their services and prices and compare them.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 3 – Provide enough project/job details</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to provide as many details as possible regarding your project or position you need to fill. The more details, the better the outcome. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 4 – Set up a dedicated team structure</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have an approximate team structure for your project, discuss it with your partner. In reality, you may need more or less developers for your project.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 5 – Familiarize with your recruiter</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the negotiation stage ends and you sign a contract with the chosen company, you get a recruiter for your project. To know that you and your recruiter are on the same page and can develop a long-term work relationship, you need to communicate your requirements/preferences to them to get an effective result.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 6 – Check your email frequently</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing that the Ukrainian IT market is growing fast, most of the candidates have numerous job offers to choose from. So, once you have contacted the recruiter, you need to check your emails regularly. The candidates’ resumes or any questions asked by the recruiter may need to be reviewed/answered as quickly as possible so that the candidate is not hired by any other organization before you make a decision.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 7 – Interview candidates</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enlisting an IT recruiting company has its own benefits. If you work with an IT outsourcing provider, you will have a recruiter assigned to your project. In any case, a recruiter arranges a fitting schedule for you and your candidates to conduct an interview. You can then determine the duration of the interviewing process, completion criteria, etc. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 8 – Provide feedback</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say, both the recruiter and candidate expect to receive feedback from you. If anything goes wrong, the recruiter should know what needs to be adjusted.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 9 – Recruit developers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you make a decision, double-check whether a candidate fits the position but don’t take too long as the candidate may accept the offer from another employer. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 10 – Get started</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you hire the right candidate for your project, it is time to introduce him to the rest of the team. Like the in-house staff, do the briefing, share the responsibilities, and introduce the working toolkit.</span></p>

<h2><b>Kotlin vs Java: Differences</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, Kotlin is similar to Java in many scenarios. However, if we make head-to-head comparison of </span><b>Kotlin vs. Java</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the differences become more noticeable:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16746" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java-vs.-Kotlin.jpg" alt="kotlin vs java android" width="512" height="384" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java-vs.-Kotlin.jpg 512w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java-vs.-Kotlin-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java-vs.-Kotlin-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<h3><b>Kotlin vs Java: Comparison</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is the table with </span><b>Kotlin vs. Java </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">comparison:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><b>Kotlin</b></td>
<td><b>Java</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Null Safety</b></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, all types of variables are non-nullable (i.e. null values cannot be assigned to variables/objects). If a developer tries to assign or return a null value, the Kotlin code will fail at compile time. However, there is a special syntax that can be used to assign null values to variables.</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most frustrating issue that Java developers face is the NullPointerExceptions. Developers can assign null values to variables but when they try to access the object that points to the null value, there comes the exception.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Extension Functions</b></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers can extend the functionality of a class using extension functions. These functions can be created by prefixing the class name that needs to get extended to the name of the function being created.</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">To extend a class with new functionality in Java, developers need to create a new class and inherit it from the parent class. Java lacks extension functions.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Co-routines Support</b></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-running tasks can be run on multiple threads but Kotlin has co-routines support that suspends the execution at a certain point without blocking the thread and then resumes the operation later on some other thread. </span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threads get blocked whenever long-running tasks are initiated in Java. Java uses the traditional method of creating a background thread to handle these operations. However, the management of multiple threads gets complicated.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Data Classes</b></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kotlin allows for creating classes for holding data in a simple way. Developers include the data keyword in the class definition and then the compiler takes care of every task.</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Java, developers need to write a lot of boilerplate code for classes to hold data. Typically, they need to define constructors, fields, getter and setter methods, equals(), hashCode(), and toString() functions.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Checked Exceptions</b></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kotlin has no checked exceptions. So, there is no need to catch or declare any exception.</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java has checked exceptions support with which developers can catch or declare exceptions.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Smart Casts</b></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smart casts feature of Kotlin handles the casting checks with ‘is’ operator that performs implicit casting.</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java requires developers to check the type of variable and cast as per the operation.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Type Inference</b></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kotlin takes type inference to another level. There is no need to specify the type of the variable as the compiler will guess its type on its own.</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java requires developers to specify the type of every variable explicitly during declaration.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Functional Programming</b></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kotlin supports object-oriented and functional programming. It consists of various useful functions like a wide array of higher-order functions, lambdas, inline functions, lazy evaluation, etc.</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java doesn’t support functional programming but it supports the subset of Java 8 specifications during Android apps development.</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<h2><b>Kotlin vs Java: Usage</b></h2>
<p><b>Kotlin</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A modern programming language, Kotlin was only used by professionals on its initial stage. Still, since Google made the announcement, Kotlin usage exploded, especially in students. Apart from being used for Android development, Kotlin is also used in web development, front-end and back-end.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16747" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-Kotlin-Is-Used-For.jpg" alt="kotlin vs java performance" width="730" height="498" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-Kotlin-Is-Used-For.jpg 800w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-Kotlin-Is-Used-For-300x205.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-Kotlin-Is-Used-For-768x524.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-Kotlin-Is-Used-For-600x410.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-Kotlin-Is-Used-For-450x307.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></p>
<p><b>Java</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java is the most extensively used programming language that is currently running on three billion devices. It is used to build commercial websites, mobile, desktop, enterprise, and scientific applications, games, application servers, big data solutions, and software tools.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16748" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-Java-Is-Used-For.jpg" alt="android kotlin vs java" width="499" height="250" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-Java-Is-Used-For.jpg 499w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-Java-Is-Used-For-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/What-Java-Is-Used-For-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></p>
<h2><b>Kotlin vs Java: Which One Is Easy to Learn?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different factors that attribute to the learning curve of a programming language. When it comes to syntax, Kotlin is more demonstrative than Java. Kotlin provides several methods to generate a cleaner code, which makes it more readable and understandable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, learning a programming language is not just about the syntax. Finding a helping hand when issues arise, that is having an established community, is important. As Java has been around for decades, it has a larger community of developers, online code libraries, and references that are particularly helpful in case any support is needed. Still, it is worth remembering that Kotlin is relatively new, so it is evident that Kotlin will stay behind Java. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, although Java is quite similar to Kotlin, programmers should learn Java to start grasping Kotlin, as the latter comes from the first. Kotlin is easy to learn only if a programmer is already familiar with Java.</span></p>
<h2><b>Kotlin vs Java: Which One Uses Less Energy?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Android developers can explain how tiring it becomes when they have to write lengthy code using Java. Java is an old programming, language and requires developers to spend hours writing the code, thereby increasing the chances of errors and bugs in it. Meanwhile, Kotlin is built to be more effective and less time and energy consuming for developers. As compared to Java, Kotlin uses 20% less code as it has various built-in features which remove the need to write boilerplate code on a regular basis. It enables developers to get more functionality with concise and compact code.</span></p>
<h3><b>Kotlin vs Java: Example of Code</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is the code example that shows the </span><b>Java vs Kotlin </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">difference in terms of number of lines required to perform the same task:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16750" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java-vs.-Kotlin-Code-Comparison-1024x849.png" alt="android java vs kotlin" width="1024" height="849" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java-vs.-Kotlin-Code-Comparison-1024x849.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java-vs.-Kotlin-Code-Comparison-300x249.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java-vs.-Kotlin-Code-Comparison-768x637.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java-vs.-Kotlin-Code-Comparison-600x498.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java-vs.-Kotlin-Code-Comparison-450x373.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java-vs.-Kotlin-Code-Comparison-1000x829.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Java-vs.-Kotlin-Code-Comparison.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is evident that Kotlin cuts the quantity of code lines by almost 40% compared to Java. After performing thorough research on </span><b>Android Java vs Kotlin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> development, Java developers definitely move to Kotlin to enjoy this feature.</span></p>
<h2><b>Kotlin vs Java: Performance</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The performance of an application is highly dependent on various factors, like the nature of OS it is being built for, developer expertise, actual code, and so on. When comparing </span><b>Kotlin performance vs Java</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both of them are pretty much the same. Since they share similar bytecode structure, there is no measurable difference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, when it comes to clean builds, Java compiles 10-15% faster than Kotlin. On the other hand, Kotlin offers some amazing built-in structures, like data classes that result in efficient and cleaner code. For consecutive incremental builds with single or no file, Kotlin can be even slightly faster than Java. However, we conclude that in this battle of </span><b>Android Kotlin vs Java </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">development, the efficiency depends on the performance of the specific JVM implementation.</span></p>
<h2><b>Kotlin vs Java: Statistics</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2017, when Google declared Kotlin as an official language for Android development, many major companies switched their Java-based apps to Kotlin. As of March 2019, around 35000 applications are using Kotlin, with the overall market share of 4.8% across Google Play.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16749" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Top-Kotlin-Apps.png" alt="kotlin performance vs java" width="600" height="475" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Top-Kotlin-Apps.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Top-Kotlin-Apps-300x238.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Top-Kotlin-Apps-450x356.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we notice all the demerits of Java, Kotlin seems to be better in the </span><b>Kotlin vs Java </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">development battle. However, Java language enjoys success in other areas.</span></p>
<h2><b>Kotlin vs Java: Future</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16751" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kotlin-vs.-Java-Future-Visualization.jpg" alt="kotlin vs. java" width="850" height="350" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kotlin-vs.-Java-Future-Visualization.jpg 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kotlin-vs.-Java-Future-Visualization-300x124.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kotlin-vs.-Java-Future-Visualization-768x316.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kotlin-vs.-Java-Future-Visualization-600x247.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Kotlin-vs.-Java-Future-Visualization-450x185.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the unquestionable position of Java in the programming world, Android needed a modern language to support applications. Kotlin filled that place perfectly, being branded as a first-class language for Android apps by Google. Kotlin was developed to offer solutions to the problems Java did not come to resolve over the years. As Google itself has become Kotlin-oriented, this fact is causing developers to move towards adopting Kotlin. Be it as it may, Java will continue to be a famous programming language, while Kotlin is now the official language for Android that will be widely adopted by forward-thinking developers and businesses in the future.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion: Java vs Kotlin. Who is the winner?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrapping it up, anyone who wants to work with Android must have good knowledge of Java, especially if mastering Kotlin is a priority. Java is the basis of Android development efforts, so if you are a newcomer who wants to gain some experience in the programming world, get started with Java. If you are already a Java developer, learning and starting development with Kotlin, the language of the future, would be a great idea. Finally, it is all about choosing the language you are comfortable with, and the one that will fit your project work!</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Top 10 JavaScript Frameworks Comparison</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different JavaScript frameworks, and assessing their advantages and drawbacks can be a challenging task. This section aims to provide a detailed comparison of JavaScript frameworks. Now, we will walk you through the pros and cons of all top JavaScript frameworks covered above.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">AngularJS</span></h3>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two-way data-binding – data synchronization between the Model and View. Any changes made in the Model are instantly displayed in the View, and vice versa.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directives. With directives, Angular.js gives developers the freedom to repeatedly use specific functions, create custom directives, and it keeps the HTML pages organized. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dependency injection – an AngularJS built-in mechanism that defines the way software components are dependent on each other. Dependency injection makes components easier to manage as well as more usable.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVVM architecture – Model-View-View Model and Model-View-Controller can be implemented using AngularJS to separate the data from the View, as well as make complex applications easy to manage.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript support required. There are many devices that do not support JS. So, your website or app may be at risk of losing a chunk of audience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVC Knowledge. If a developer is unfamiliar with MVC architecture, using Angular.js can become extremely difficult and time-consuming.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance issues. As the AngularJS framework is used to develop dynamic apps, they often end up big in size and start exhibiting glitches as a result.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">ReactJS</span></h3>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual DOM. React.js uses the abstract copy of the real DOM – Virtual DOM. With it, developers can work faster, use hot reloading, and make UI smoother.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unidirectional data flow. One-way data flow in ReactJS ensures that any changes made to child elements will not affect the parent elements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JSX. React utilizes JSX (basic JS that uses HTML-like syntax) to make components code readable and display how components get put together.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reusing code components. With this feature, developers can create isolated ReactJS components that can be modified later and make the development process speedier and more precise.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor documentation. With technologies advancing and updating so fast, it becomes difficult for developers to write proper documentation, and they end up following the information that lacks clarity and completeness.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High development speed. With the constantly changing development environment, it gets hard for developers to adapt to every change and  roll-out continuous updates.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steep learning curve. If you want to integrate a UI library into the MVC framework, learning to do it with React.js requires extensive knowledge and putting in a lot of effort.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">VueJS</span></h3>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Templates. VueJS uses HTML-based templates that combine its instance data with DOM.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two-way communication. Similar to some other famous JavaScript frameworks, Vue facilitates two-way communication and speeds up the HTML blocks handling.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reactivity. Vue has a highly reactive system in which changes in models instantly update the View.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy integration – Vue.js couples nicely with other applications and server-side frameworks.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16718" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Vue-Works-1024x544.png" alt="vue.js" width="796" height="423" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Vue-Works-1024x544.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Vue-Works-300x159.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Vue-Works-768x408.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Vue-Works-600x319.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Vue-Works-450x239.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Vue-Works-1000x531.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Vue-Works.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" /></p>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unnecessarily high flexibility. It is nice to have a flexible framework, but a framework that is too flexible can over-complicate a project and may lead to errors in the code.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor support. It is a relatively new library, with a small team behind it. Do not expect timely updates and plan accordingly if you decided to use Vue.js. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">EmberJS</span></h3>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ember-CLI — a command-line utility that comes with Ember stack. Ember-CLI provides support for tools including HandleBars, LeSS, SaSS, CoffeeScript, and other. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ember templates. Built into Ember’s UI, templates are coded using the HandleBars templating language. They help developers create stunning UIs using less code.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ember Inspector. This tool allows developers to inspect Ember objects in the development and debugging processes easier.</span></li>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unstable API. Node.js API constantly changes at frequent intervals and remains unstable. When this happens, developers have to make changes to their code to stay compatible with latest Node API. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor third-party software management tools. Node’s numerous tools that are used in installing and managing third-party software are of poor quality. It seems that they have not been supervised properly and fail to meet common coding standards.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">PolymerJS</span></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16721" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Polymer-JS-structure.png" alt="polymer.js" width="525" height="431" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Polymer-JS-structure.png 525w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Polymer-JS-structure-300x246.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Polymer-JS-structure-450x369.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web components. Built on the idea of reusable web components, Polymer employs them to break apps into portions of fitting size and create usable widgets in web documentation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data binding. Polymer supports both one-way and two-way data binding, which makes the application area extensive.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polyfills. Polymer uses modern APIs for web interfaces and offers polyfills for browsers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed. Polymer works three times faster on Chrome and four times faster on Safari than other top JavaScript front-end frameworks,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom elements. Polymer.js allows developers to create their own custom HTML elements.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of server-side rendering. While developers can work with PolymerJS on the client side, it cannot be rendered on the server side. As a result, page load speed is affected.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited resources. Polymer.js has a small support community and limited resources available on the web, which makes it less popular in the industry.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">AureliaJS</span></h3>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Standards. AureliaJS is one of the cleanest modern JavaScript frameworks, and the one which focuses on the web standards without any concern for needless abstractions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensible HTML. With this feature of Aurelia.js, developers can create custom HTML elements for data binding and dynamic loading.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-language support. Aurelia’s APIs are designed to be compatible with every today’s and tomorrow’s popular programming language.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modular framework. Aurelia is made up of small modules, with each serving a particular purpose. They can be used together as a full-featured framework, or employed in building a custom solution.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low traction. Unlike other top JS frameworks, AureliaJS does not enjoy much popularity. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited resources. Aurelia.js has a little community and limited resources. As a result, the framework has a steep learning curve.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">BackboneJS<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16722" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Backbone-JS-works.png" alt="backbone.js" width="657" height="479" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Backbone-JS-works.png 657w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Backbone-JS-works-300x219.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Backbone-JS-works-600x437.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-Backbone-JS-works-450x328.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" /></span></h3>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backend synchronization. Backbone.js provides great support for RESTful APIs, so Models can be easily tied to the back-end.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event-driven communication. The framework provides an event-driven communication between Models and Views to prevent the code from being difficult to read.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RESTful JSON Interface. Backbone has a RESTful JSON interface based on the MVP application model. This format is used to perform data serialization and provide better support for browser clients.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficult to learn. Backbone.js has a steep learning curve.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsuitable for large data sets. The framework does not provide any data binding process, which makes it unsuitable for pages with that usually exhibit high data loads.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underscore templates. Backbone.js uses Underscore templates that are not as comprehensive as those provided by other top JS frameworks.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Future of JavaScript Frameworks</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16723" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Future-of-Javascript-Frameworks-Visualization.jpg" alt="Future of Javascript Frameworks" width="343" height="378" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Future-of-Javascript-Frameworks-Visualization.jpg 343w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Future-of-Javascript-Frameworks-Visualization-272x300.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many top JavaScript frameworks continue gaining traction among developers, so their future looks bright. Still, if we talk about top javascript front-end frameworks, Angular.js is an absolute champion with rocketing demand, with ReactJS and VueJS catching up in popularity. When it comes to back-end JavaScript frameworks, Node.js definitely continues to grow in terms of performance and features more rapidly than other back-end frameworks.</span></p>
<h2><b>Final Thoughts</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope our round-up provided you with a really comprehensive and actionable overview of JavaScript top frameworks to choose from for your upcoming project. The JavaScript (JS) frameworks list that we have discussed above shows the benefits and shortcomings of each framework, so you can clearly see where each framework works best. Still, do not forget that prior to picking the right one for your project, you need to have the feature list, the architecture, and required performance level. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you lead a startup or a much bigger company, every enterprise often needs external help in completing their software solutions or digital transformation efforts. Technologies evolve quickly, new ones emerge from time to time, and you simply cannot expect every software engineer on your team to know it all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As learning always takes time, the deadlines are pressing, and consumer demand changes fast, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the question of how to find an app developer or an entire team to complete a project could arise at any moment. Still, projects differ in size, and budgets are not limitless. How do you find the right app developers then?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we show and explain how to find an app developer or development team for any project and business size, as well as different scenarios — so you can find the solution for your case as soon as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, we address four common situations when you might need hiring app developers, and provide possible solutions, explaining how you can hire the right experts. Second, we list six ways you can find app developers for any project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start.</span></p>
<h2><strong>4 Ways You Can Hire App Developers</strong></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 &#8212; How To Hire App Developers &amp; Teams For Big Projects</span></h3>
<p><b>Outsourcing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile app development has long emerged as the top choice for businesses across industries. When you outsource, you hand over your project to a team of external experts, provided by an outsourcing company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies turn to this service for a number of reasons:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Lack of the necessary expertise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some companies might have an in-house software development team, but it could lack the expertise in a certain technology or be involved in another project. For example, a business needs to create an AR app, but they only have a busy web development team. As a result, finding and hiring app developers with AR expertise from an outsourcing company emerges as a good option.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pressing time frame</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, customer demand changes extremely fast, and the quicker you deliver the product, the better. If you do not have the right experts, training the existing team or hiring new developers may take up a substantial amount of time. Outsourcing companies are built to solve that issue and help you find and hire app developers that would suit your project demands and company culture. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cost-efficiency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Maintaining an in-house team brings many benefits, but it is also highly expensive. Count in monthly salary, office and equipment expenses, as well as other costs, and you will get big numbers, especially if you need niche expertise. With outsourcing, you have immense budget flexibility in hiring app developers: you can scale your team up and down — or add an expert only for a period of time needed to finish a certain part of the product. On top of that, you do not have to pay for equipment or office space, as the outsourcing company covers that costs. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>High Flexibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There is more to outsourcing’s appeal when it comes to flexibility. As outsourcing services have been growing in toe with customer demand, modern providers offer a multitude of benefits for companies that want to hire app developers on specific terms. With outsourcing, a team can work onshore (a provider’s office are located in the same country of origin as your business or business branch), nearshore (a nearby country), or offshore (faraway countries). Whether you want close collaboration, satisfied with video meetings, or need a combination of both, there is an option for every business case. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16770" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developers-at-Work-1024x683.jpg" alt="how to find an app developer" width="651" height="434" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developers-at-Work-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developers-at-Work-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developers-at-Work-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developers-at-Work-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developers-at-Work-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developers-at-Work-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">When It Is Better To Outsource?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing is the best option for well-funded startups, medium-sized companies, and enterprises. All of them might lack either resources or expertise for certain projects. If you are in charge of a relatively small company, you may only need to hire an app developer that will single-handedly cover all your needs. Otherwise, it is not cost-efficient (find out more on how to </span><b>find an app developer for small projects and companies below</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 &#8212; How To Hire a Mobile App Developer With Niche Skills, Without Hiring an Entire Team</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say you have a large project rolling forward at full speed. It is innovative, and involves multiple technologies. Everything is going according to plan, and there seems to be nothing ahead to prevent your team from meeting the deadline. Suddenly, one of IoT experts on your team (for example, a very experienced embedded software engineer), receives a job offer they cannot refuse. No matter what you say and how satisfying everything is, the engineer says they cannot simply ignore the offer. Unfortunately, you are left without an important expert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A service called </span><b>outstaffing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will help you fill in the gap as quickly as possible. With this model, you can hire a mobile app developer with the right skills who can quickly fit in with your team and help you get your project back on track and further to the fast lane. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to </span><b>add a certain technology to an existing product</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>but do not have the right experts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can use outstaffing services to find and hire app developers with the right skills. For example, you want to add AR to your mobile product, which has Android and iOS versions. In this case, you will need to hire mobile app developers for both platforms who also have AR expertise (and, maybe, an AR solution architect).</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16771" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developer-Hired-with-Outstaffing-at-Work-1024x684.jpg" alt="find app developers" width="653" height="436" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developer-Hired-with-Outstaffing-at-Work-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developer-Hired-with-Outstaffing-at-Work-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developer-Hired-with-Outstaffing-at-Work-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developer-Hired-with-Outstaffing-at-Work-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developer-Hired-with-Outstaffing-at-Work-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/App-Developer-Hired-with-Outstaffing-at-Work-1000x668.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another big benefit of outstaffing is </span><b>shared knowledge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Any developer prefers to share their knowledge and expand it beyond the field they started from. For instance, you have mobile app developers, but they lack AR expertise for one of the projects. When you hire app developers with the skills that your team lacks, they will share that knowledge in the process of cooperating on a project. That is, when you outstaff you also invest into education of your employees and, consequently, into your business. More so, your developers will be learning not from a lecture, workshop, or else, but a real-life project with an expert in the field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outstaffing is also </span><b>cost-efficient and flexible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you need to add a DevOps engineer for a limited time to the experts you already hired for a project, you can do so. Outstaffing providers offer scalability as required. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 &#8212; How to Hire Mobile App Developer for a Small Project/Company</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning to outsourcing, outstaffing, or similar ways of hiring mobile app developers (you would also come across team extension, for example) is rarely the option for small projects or companies. These services are aimed at bigger companies, projects, and teams, and do not make sense for smallers ones from the business perspective. Instead, small companies or projects can win from more suitable options to hire a developer to make an app. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16772" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Developers-on-Upwork-1024x562.png" alt="find an app developer" width="863" height="473" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Developers-on-Upwork-1024x562.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Developers-on-Upwork-300x165.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Developers-on-Upwork-768x421.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Developers-on-Upwork-600x329.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Developers-on-Upwork-450x247.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Developers-on-Upwork-1000x549.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Developers-on-Upwork.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Upwork</em></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Freelance websites</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a great option for short to mid-term projects. Existing freelance platforms like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upwork</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiverr</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have many app developers for hire across a wide array of technology areas and programming languages. With simple and streamlined user experiences and rating systems, you can use these platforms for hiring app developers you can rely on. However, if you consider hiring freelancers for the long-term due to tempting cost-efficiency possibilities, we do not recommend doing so. Freelance app developers usually like to have a number of different projects, and often they take on several at a time. Therefore, with this option, you cannot count on long-term consistency and commitment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Job search websites</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although freelancing is a popular mode of work/lifestyle choice, it does not fit everyone. Hence, you can rely on a tried-and-true option and hire mobile application developer with a job search website. This option can work both for long and short term, it all depends on what a developer expects and what you both can agree on. You can also expect a large number of CVs to choose from. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 &#8212; How To Hire Mobile App Developers For an In-House Team</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you need to build a reliable in-house team. This is the most expensive way to go, but it has some major advantages over other options. First, high dependability and consistency. An in-house team is always there, ready to get to work and solve an issue. Second, an in-house team would be familiar with your IT infrastructure, software projects, and how your business works in general. As a result, they would be able to provide better solutions to issues and challenges, and do it faster. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16773" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-house-team-at-a-meeting-min-1024x768.jpg" alt="hire app developers" width="655" height="491" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-house-team-at-a-meeting-min-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-house-team-at-a-meeting-min-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-house-team-at-a-meeting-min-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-house-team-at-a-meeting-min-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-house-team-at-a-meeting-min-450x337.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-house-team-at-a-meeting-min-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, building a solid in-house team for the long-term takes a lot of time and effort. You will need several in-house HR experts or help from a recruitment agency to secure the developers you need. Here, finding an experienced project manager could be a great start. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, an in-house team will be a costly option in every aspect. Your company would need to allocate costs to monthly salaries, equipment, office space, training, as well as other costs. The good news? Big urban centers offer flexible workspaces that provide office essentials and a comfortable environment in general. Some of them are built solely for software and mobile development companies, so your experts will also gain benefits from sharing knowledge with colleagues from other companies. If your business is small and growing, or you are a startup, you can find options to stay flexible. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>6 Ways You Can Find App Developers</strong> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you finish selecting the most fitting mode of operation for your business, it is time to compile a list of potential partners/developers. There are many different places and platforms online where you can find mobile app developers.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 &#8212; Find mobile app developers with B2B research firms &amp; ratings </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to find an outsourcing or outstaffing partner to hire app developers from, this is a solid option. B2B firms like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clutch</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer comprehensive rating systems, which allow for finding the right partner quickly by putting the spotlight on reviews and concise company profiling. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16774" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Clutch.co-Company-Profile-1024x511.png" alt="hiring app developers" width="1024" height="511" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Clutch.co-Company-Profile-1024x511.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Clutch.co-Company-Profile-300x150.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Clutch.co-Company-Profile-768x383.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Clutch.co-Company-Profile-600x300.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Clutch.co-Company-Profile-450x225.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Clutch.co-Company-Profile-1000x499.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Clutch.co-Company-Profile.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Clutch</em></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 &#8212; Hire a team or developer based on recommendations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you need a team or only looking for mobile app developer, getting in touch with partners and friends who currently have or had the same challenges may solve your problem. They would recommend an outsourcing service provider or a developer, providing you with front-row feedback that is often missing from reviews and elsewhere online. That is, you will know the real advantages and disadvantages of your potential partner. When you are investing a lot of money in a project, this is the best way to go. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 &#8212; Find &amp; hire a mobile app developer on freelance platforms </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we detailed above, you can always find an app developer on freelance websites like Upwork. If you only need to solve a small issue or have a small project, you can hire an app developer shortly after finding them at the website. Rating and profiling systems like Upwork’s are clear and feedback-driven, providing a foundation to make a reliable decision. </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 &#8212; Looking for an app developer with niche skills? Check out their blog</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we pointed up earlier in this article, developers enjoy sharing the knowledge, and a great many have their own blogs where they share insights and expertise. This is how developer communities work and the software world spins. So, if you need an IoT engineer, you can browse IoT publications on, for example, Medium, and try and find the right expert there. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 &#8212; Find a programmer for an app by doing online research</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know how to choose reliable outsourcing partners and where to look on their websites, this option may prove to be a good starting point. If not, look at these three things first and foremost: clients and case studies, years on the market (ten years of experience is great), and a clear and established development process. Also, couple this option with other ones on the list, like checking potential partners you found on B2B firms’ ratings and getting in touch with your partners. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 &#8212; Find a programmer for an app on GitHub</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not the most evident way to find an app developer, the world’s largest code hosting has millions of experts from across technology areas who contribute source code to millions of repositories. There, you or an expert on your team can find the right experts and check their code quality as it is.</span></p>
