								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our previous article, we have elaborately explored IFC file formats and other </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/bim-open-standards-for-aec-digitization-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open BIM standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which one can use in enterprise systems in the AEC industry. In this article, we are moving further into the subject and will be looking into open source BIM software and components that you can use to build a BIM infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without further ado, let’s explore BIM servers, 3D model viewers, validators, and a range of other useful tools for building such an infrastructure.</span></p>
<h2><b>BIM Repositories</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central BIM model storage is the cornerstone of a robust information system. BIM models used to be stored as files in cloud services like Dropbox, SharePoint, and shared FTP servers for a long time. Users had to keep track of versions manually and change filenames with every next version of a BIM model to distinguish one iteration from another. </span></p>
<h2><b>BIMserver — From Many Files to a Single Database</b></h2>
<p><a href="http://bimserver.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIMServer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an enterprise-grade open-source software that was developed to support the transition of file-based BIM storage to the realm of online databases. The stability of BIMserver is proven in the enterprise, as many commercial applications are built with it. The upcoming release of </span><b>Version 1.5</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will add full support for IFC4 and IFC4 Add 2 specifications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIMserver operates on the object model that evolved from IFC specifications into Entity Modeling Framework entities, which in turn are stored in a persistent key-value database. The latter uses embedded Berkeley DB Java Edition — one of the best libraries on the market.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15879" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bimserver-arch-813x1024.png" alt="open BIM software" width="640" height="806" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bimserver-arch-813x1024.png 813w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bimserver-arch-238x300.png 238w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bimserver-arch-768x968.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bimserver-arch-600x756.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bimserver-arch-357x450.png 357w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bimserver-arch-794x1000.png 794w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bimserver-arch.png 1338w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplified BIMserver architecture. Image credit: Article &#8220;Bimserver.org &#8211; an Open Source IFC model server&#8221; (2010)<br />
</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This library is the most suitable option for an internal BIM repository that needs to manage models amounting to many gigabytes. Plus, BerkleyDB’s modular architecture and broad set of supported plugins will help you further extend the functionality if your project requires it.</span></p>
<h2><b>BIM Components &amp; Viewers</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s look at a set of BIM components that you might need for viewing, editing, and modifying BIM models online and on a desktop. Some of them are building blocks that can be re-used in different scenarios, while other are fully functioning, standalone software solutions.</span></p>
<h3><b>IfcOpenShell — Helpful Library with Geometry Conversion</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IFC file format requires the support of many internal objects descriptions by class that you can process and analyse later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In visualization, you need to to convert the IFC parametric representation to triangles that can be understood by GPU rendering software. This is were </span><a href="http://ifcopenshell.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IfcOpenShell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shines, helping you with object descriptions, file parsing, and conversion into triangles for 3D visualizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IfcOpenShell was written in C++ and has Python bindings as well as an interactive mode. There is also a set of derivative BIM open source software products available from the IfcOpenShell community —  IfcMax, IfcBlender, IfcConvert, IfcOpenShell-python, and BIMserver plug-in.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15889 size-large" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/OpenIfcShell-render-1024x516.png" alt="open source BIM software" width="640" height="323" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/OpenIfcShell-render-1024x516.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/OpenIfcShell-render-300x151.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/OpenIfcShell-render-768x387.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/OpenIfcShell-render-600x303.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/OpenIfcShell-render-450x227.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/OpenIfcShell-render-1000x504.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/OpenIfcShell-render.png 1832w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Over the past 20 years, advanced technologies and innovations have changed the way the hospitality industry brings value to travelers around the world. With all the opportunities, digital transformation is reshaping the industry, leaving some players behind, customers’ behavior has shifted with astonishing speed towards new, innovative experiences.</p>
<p>Digital transformation is, no doubt, one of the key drivers of industry growth today. But since the sudden COVID-19 pandemic outbreak hit the “pause button” hard-full stop, the hospitality industry especially is losing its positions day after day.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, consumers always continue to demand improved solutions and unique experiences. The industry is rapidly adopting new technologies to exceed their expectations and digitize the customer journey with one-tap check-ins, digital concierge services, voice-activated devices, chatbots, smart in-room technologies, advanced analytics, virtual-assistant platforms, enhanced direct bookings, and more to come.</p>
<h1>Travel. Transformed.</h1>
<p>Many companies from the hospitality industry are still only entering the new exciting world of digitalization. To create a more seamless guest experience, more hotels automate and streamline the travel processes, developing the advanced tools necessary to capture the full potential of data.</p>
<p>Moreover, considering that millennials are increasingly dominating the travel sector, hospitality companies should be prepared to curate and personalized travel offerings and to make a data-enabled transformation work. This generation of tech-savvy travelers prefers using apps for bookings and getting more personalized interactions. The cultural change, as well as the long-term impact of automation, machine learning, and even robotics, are here to stay.</p>
<p>Intellectsoft’s experts have developed an in-depth overview of digital transformation trends in hospitality and what to expect from hotels of the future presented in this infographics:</p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/tech-trends-2020/">5 Tech Trends of 2020 Every CIO Needs to Know</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog">Intellectsoft Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If previous years were mostly marked by the exciting evolution of emerging technologies, 2020 will be different. Technology advances will often be accompanied by various public and private issues that companies and the public will need to consider and deal with. Still, this doesn’t mean 2020 won’t hold anything exciting, or that the big-scale adoption of new technologies will stop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will make projections across 5 technology areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI algorithms in fake news and the future of media</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The not-so-comfortable truth about the state of AR &amp; VR adoption </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endpoint growth, edge computing, and other IoT industry trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial organizations embracing a shared ecosystem</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First steps of face recognition technology in financial services</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many interesting developments to talk about. Let’s start.</span></p>
<h2><strong>AI Trends: Algorithms in Media &amp; Fake News</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media industry has already seen AI-driven virtual TV presenters </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJcdVjkqiW8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The technology paves the way for a potential revolution in the industry, allowing media companies to produce a lot of content on-the-fly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, over the last two years, the public, the media, governmental organizations, and prominent artists have grown increasingly alarmed about how deepfakes can sway opinions online, influencing political events. In 2017, the University of Washington created the notorious </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/01/business/pentagons-race-against-deepfakes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deepfake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmUC4m6w1wo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Barack Obama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there was a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a deepfake video of Mark Zuckerberg, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE1KWpoX9Hk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other examples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The resemblance between the real and fake political figures proved almost uncanny, prompting discussions about the big perils of deepfake technology and other AI uses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, doctored videos can be spotted upon closer examination, but the technology keeps evolving, while easy-to-use deepfake creation tools are available online. Although </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251736/deepfake-propaganda-misinformation-troll-video-hoax" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">current countermeasures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can detect deepfakes and their creators quickly and easily, this may change soon: the technology is evolving, so the countermeasures will need to evolve as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fighting fake articles online will be more challenging, though. MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) has been going to great lengths to showcase the scale of the problem. CSAIL has conducted two scientific investigations (publishing a paper for each in the August of 2019), and both showed that current AI-driven fake news detecting systems, no matter how sophisticated, are not effective enough and face many nuanced challenges.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/15/mit-csail-fights-fake-news-with-ai/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With other companies joining the battle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, (including Facebook), this means that we will definitely see more sophisticated AI tools aimed at reducing the quantity and impact of fake news in 2020 and beyond, across the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The laws will follow suit as well. In 2020, we may expect new deepfake and fake news scandals, hearings on that cases, as well as first instances of comprehensive regulation in the most progressive countries. All popular platforms would use AI algorithms to automatically detect and block deepfakes and fake news, as well as trace their creators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, trends in AI will be a hot topic in 2020.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Augmented &amp; Virtual Reality Trends Slow Down</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although established companies use AR in </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-brands-use-augmented-reality-in-manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacturing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/microsoft-hololens-usage-in-construction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-ar-apps-changed-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other industries, the general adoption progresses slowly. Games and gamified customer experiences continue to be the main driver for both AR and VR. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/future-ar-vr-survey/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a survey by XRDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fifty-nine percent of AR and VR projects are game-related. This won’t change anytime soon, at least for VR. Steam will be pushing its </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976234/valve-half-life-alyx-steamvr-index-headset-gaming-storefront-platform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SteamVR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platform with the recently announced Half-Life: Alyx, driving the competition on the VR market. Still, the adoption of both technologies continues to grow steadily in other industries, like education and training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As AR has been growing slowly in the last two years, there is no indication this will change in 2020, despite the release of HoloLens 2 in November 2019. There is the usual back-and-forth in the rumours about Apple’s AR headset, but hard evidence on whatever the company is developing will are non-existent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, we can expect AR to continue breathing new life into familiar experiences. Readers tired of consuming content the old way will definitely enjoy immersive experiences and new story angles enabled by the technology, like those seen in The New York Times </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/augmented-reality" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR/VR section</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and by </span><a href="https://time.com/5628880/time-immersive-app-ar-vr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIME’s new AR/VR app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for other augmented reality trends, the technology will also help ecommerce drive sales in 2020 and beyond. As customers are tired of the same types of ads and their ubiquity, brands will follow into the steps of Instagram (who released its </span><a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spark AR Studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to public this year), building AR catalogues of their goods and creating digital experiences with AR lenses in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR lenses and filters are booming, but they should be approached carefully by development teams in the future. For example, Instagram removed filters that depict or promote cosmetic surgery amid concerns they </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50152053"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harm mental health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR try-in on web pages and in mobile apps would also gain more traction. This option is more cost-effective compared to other AR solutions as well as convenient for users, who would only need to open the camera on their smartphone to try a T-shirt or sunglasses on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002243591930020X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by four UK universities, AR improves decision comfort, prompts users to give positive word-of-mouth recommendations, and drives sales of more expensive products.  </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17616" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1024x683.jpg" alt="augmented reality trends" width="780" height="520" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big-scale adoption of AR will continue in 2020 with products like Adobe’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/adobe-launches-aero-its-ar-authoring-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allows designers to create AR experience without coding easily. The iPad app gives users a step-by-step guide on how to build AR scenes, allowing them to use their existing assets from the Adobe Creative Cloud. The app allows to create basic AR experiences, with the full-fledged version coming to desktop in 2020. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Internet of Things — Adoption Continues  </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the IoT industry trends are connected to streamlining existing IoT-driven operations further, sustating IoT device growth, and building massive ecosystems.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Tapping into IoT Metadata</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last decade, enterprises have been gathering and using data from smart endpoint devices in their IoT ecosystems to a great extent. The next step will be </span><a href="https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/internet-of-things/5-emerging-iot-trends-to-watch-in-2020/3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using that data’s metadata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to drive intelligence systems, increasing the level of personalization further, and giving context to otherwise incomprehensive scenarios in data sets. As a result, the companies will be able to structure unstructured data and improve the process of developing their cognitive systems.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Confident Endpoint Growth</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying on the subject of endpoints, their number will grow in 2020, as devices like smart meters, smart lighting, and smart air conditioning are becoming increasingly common in commercial and residential markets. </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-08-29-gartner-says-5-8-billion-enterprise-and-automotive-io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Gartner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the utilities industry, who is the leader in endpoint usage, was operating 1.17 billion endpoints in 2019, and the firm projects the number will grow by 14.6 percent in 2020, reaching 1.37 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the governmental sector will see a more dramatic spike: from 0.53 billion to 0.70 billion (24.3 percent). The quantity of endpoints will also grow substantially in the building automation and physical security industries. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Other Internet of Things Trends: Edge Computing, Digital Twins</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What else can be expected in the IoT area in 2020? </span><a href="https://www.techcentral.ie/iot-in-2020-awkward-times-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to IDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enterprises will begin transitioning from cloud-based IoT deployments to edge computing to further streamline IoT deployments and application performance in their ecosystems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for big trends in IoT, the Port of Rotterdam, the largest in Europe, has started a massive project of digitizing its every operation, which will continue in 2020. Some parts of the harbor are already automated, but the ports leadership and partners plan to use the digital twin technology and IoT for a complete digital transformation. The end goal is to entirely rid the port of time loss, cargo loss, spills of CO2, and safety incidents. The harbor also wants to berth crewless automated ships somewhere around 2030. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about the port’s plans and progress in detail in the video:</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Port of Rotterdam: Europe&#039;s Strongest Digital Twin Case Study | IoT World Europe 2018 webinar" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_ihbnUuAAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Open &amp; Decentralized Finance</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all likelihood, 2020 will be a watermark year for banks and financial institutions, as they face the inevitability of a large-scale transformation. The concept of open finance — an ecosystem of shared services that converges users and companies in one place to enable better efficiency and experiences — will be the overarching trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that financial organizations will have shared transaction data, IT infrastructure, and cross-compatible systems, while the ecosystem itself will be enabled by distributed technologies and more sophisticated and accessible APIs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed technology will play a key role in the evolution of the entire industry, giving way to decentralized financial services: lending, borrowing, and other financial operations will be provided on decentralized distributed platforms. Banks will use distributed ledgers to issue bonds (</span><a href="https://media.consensys.net/5-sibos-takeaways-the-future-of-finance-according-to-banks-and-institutions-a45fd53298fe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Societe Generale and Santander did</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), as digital markets with tokenized financial instruments will emerge. Payments, meanwhile, will be transferred to permission-based distributed networks to enable high security and speed.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Face Recognition in Financial Services</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As facial recognition is available in more and more smartphones and can help financial organizations cut costs and simplify operations and customer experiences, we can expect more financial services that use face recognition at different customer touchpoints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users will be able to verify different actions related to their accounts in seconds by letting smartphones scan their faces. Still, this will require a high level of security from both the financial institutions, smartphone designers, and software teams behind mobile operating systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of a federated identity — using your face to manage all of your financial operations — is also on the table, but it will take time to evolve. Mexico has </span><a href="https://observer.com/2019/11/trueface-artificial-intelligence-facial-recognition-future-banking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a biometric security mandate to bring this idea to life, so we can probably expect other countries to follow suit in 2020.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Summing Up Technology Trends for 2020</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although major breakthroughs are not in the cards, 2020 will be yet another eventful year for the tech industry and the world. AI will play the most important role at the both sides of the fake news war in 2020, prompting governments to come up with never-before-seen laws. AR adoption has slowed down significantly, and this may continue until Apple releases its first AR device. IoT adoption continues, as companies across industries tap into new types of data, use more endpoints, and find ways to streamline deployments; massive IoT projects like digitization of the Port of Rotterdam are also underway. With no time left to postpone transformation, financial organizations embrace modern times with big plans for setting up shared systems to deliver next-gen user experiences. Finally, face recognition is slowly coming to financial operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s still going to be exciting. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/intellectsoft" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stay tuned</a>.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise software integration is always complicated by different closed-source and proprietary systems that often do not communicate with each other well. Such difficulties are common to companies where digitization level is not high, the ones that outsource critical development projects to multiple vendors, and that only have a CIO and several system administrators in their IT department. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more different software systems the company uses, the more file formats and process variations it has. Therefore, looking into a common denominator via open standards and file formats is reasonable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will briefly review open BIM standards and file formats for the construction industry commonly used today, especially when it comes to Building Information Modeling (BIM) representation.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Collaboration at the Core of Bim</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Information Modeling started emerging in the 1970s. The concept is aimed at streamlining collaboration between parties engaged in design, estimation, simulation, construction, maintenance, as well as support of complex structures, for example a residential building, an airport, or a bridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIM system should be capable of representing the physical and intrinsic properties of a building/structure as an object-oriented model connected to a database. In a BIM system, object definitions are mostly described parametrically: the objects itself and their relationships with each other are described with a set of interlinked parameters. These parameters can be easily modified, leading to recalculations in the final design forms and structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus the current trend is to move the collaboration from bid construction schemes to integrated project delivery systems, which allow everyone involved in the project access the same BIM models. </span></p>
<h2><strong>IFC &amp; buildingSMART</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is an object-based data model and format that describes building and construction industry data. It was developed in 1995 by buildingSMART alliance, an international organization that focuses on improving data exchange between software solutions used in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry Foundation Classes is registered as an official International Standard ISO. Governmental clients that contract with construction companies often require a BIM system and BIM processes based on IFC open standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the buildingSMART model is a solid starting point for an internal digitization project that leverages BIM open standards and makes a company fitting for a big government project. Notably, UK, Singapore, Japan, the U.S., and the Nordic Region are the countries that lead in BIM adoption.</span></p>
<h2><b>IFC File Formats</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IFC files come in three major formats:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>(.ifc)</strong> STEP physical file — described in EXPRESS data definition language; text-based and compact</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>(.ifcXML)</strong> XML-based file format — described in XML Schema 1.0, as defined by W3C; human-readable, but larger by ~300-400% compared to .ifc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>(.ifcZIP)</strong> — compressed format consisting of either .ifc or .ifcXML files.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IFC BIM model is an object-based representation of physical objects. In case of a door, this would its constitutional material, geometry, various layers with different characteristics, including weight, light reflection, and others — all of which can be used later for cost estimation, simulation, and physical events modeling. </span></p>
<h2><b>Layered Architecture</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IFC format describes objects and interaction concepts in four different layers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Resource </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">layer: the lowest level that consists of resource definitions that are used by definitions on a higher level</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Core</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> layer: all definitions of entities here are basic and can be referred to independently or as a part of an object defined on higher layers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Interoperability</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> layer: definitions of entities that are specific to a particular product and often used by multiple parties on a construction project within one domain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Domain</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> layer: the highest level of entities, products, processes, and resources specific to a certain discipline. This objects are used in information exchange between domains with different specialization.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15817" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IFC4_layered_architecture.png" alt="BIM Standards" width="560" height="600" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IFC4_layered_architecture.png 560w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IFC4_layered_architecture-280x300.png 280w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IFC4_layered_architecture-420x450.png 420w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Image 1 &#8212; IFC4 layers visualization</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry Foundation Classes model is highly complex and covers a vast concept space; a single architect or software package does not leverage all available parameters and classes. A given process is usually restricted to a subset of specific classes with a limited number of parameters and resources needed for a specific job at a given stage of interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same way, export and import capabilities can also be restricted (or defined) by a subset of objects needed, for example, for traffic simulation or estimation of building a steel structural building facade.</span></p>
<h2><b>Model View Definition (MVD)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Model View Definition (MVD) describes a subset of IFC schema while also limiting file size and model complexity to facilitate data exchange between parties. MVDs identify what should be expected for an exchange to be effective. It helps systems on both ends; the exporter knows what is required and what is not required. There are a couple of standard MVDs.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15819" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/0_4ywPuzqrjnH09r3S.png" alt="BIM Open Standrads" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/0_4ywPuzqrjnH09r3S.png 800w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/0_4ywPuzqrjnH09r3S-300x207.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/0_4ywPuzqrjnH09r3S-768x530.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/0_4ywPuzqrjnH09r3S-600x414.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/0_4ywPuzqrjnH09r3S-450x311.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Image 2 &#8212; BIM general visualization</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>Coordination View (CV)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the most commonly implemented definition of the IFC schema. It targets the coordination between the architectural, mechanical, and structural engineering tasks during the design phase. This was the first definition developed by buildingSMART tech team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main purpose of CV is to allow for BIM model sharing between major disciplines of architecture, structural engineering, and mechanical building services. CV includes elements for spatial structuring, building, and building services needed to coordinate design in these areas.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15818" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/cv2-0_overview.png" alt="National BIM Standards" width="340" height="340" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/cv2-0_overview.png 340w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/cv2-0_overview-150x150.png 150w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/cv2-0_overview-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image 3: MVD &#8212; Coordination View Version 2.0</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coordination view can be re-editable by the receiving app; however, round-trip scenario for exchange is not defined.</span></p>
<h2><b>IFC4 Design Transfer View</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IFC4 Design Transfer View targets all workflows based on models that are handed over to be performed in next workflows, also allowing for modifications of its content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the exchange needs, the IFC4 Design Transfer View supports editing of interconnected elements. With IFC4, one can insert, delete, move, and modify building elements and spaces across different tools from different disciplines. An architect can send the initial design to an engineer who in turn can make structural changes and then return the model for further processing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internally, design parameters of higher levels must be preserved for those elements that span multiple disciplines, while applications must generate downstream geometry consistently in accordance with the parameters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to buildingSMART, here are the common characteristics of the workflow design transfer models:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source of the BIM information can be shared</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basic parametric behavior, and thereby the intellectual engineering property, can be transferred</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Model ownership and responsibility for its correctness can be transferred</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Original model published as IFC4 Design Transfer model reflects the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as-is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> status</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receiver of the IFC4 Design Transfer View does not need to have access to all the pieces of the model</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receiver of the IFC4 Design Transfer View can analyze and extract the information contained in a model</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receiver of the IFC4 Design Transfer View can modify the model</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the receiver suggests or demands a change, it can be made to the model directly</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The characteristics indicate that such a system is ready for centralized BIM repository storage and multi-agent interaction based on a central database of building information.</span></p>
<h2><b>IFC4 vs. IFC2x3</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you compare IFC2x3 with IFC4, one of the most important things to remember is that they are not directly compatible. The buildingSMART tech team removed a number of elements from IFC4, while several other elements were extended and improved upon. Therefore, one should use IFC2x3 Coordination View 2.0 (illustrated above on Image 3) to exchange data with old software solutions.</span></p>
<h2><b>BIMSie: BIM in the Cloud</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIM Service interface exchange (BIMSie) its the standard API for BIM Web Services that enables BIM in the cloud and provides a way for communication between systems. It is a data-driven concept with a well-defined API structure. Having a standard API like BIMSie for BIM servers opens the possibility to develop software solutions that automatically work with every BIM server that supports the standard. As a result, BIMSie reduces software development cost, adoption, and interoperability within the industry.</span></p>
<h2><b>LandXML: Land Development Industry Format</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure projects like roads, bridges, and railways demand slightly different types of data and parameters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">XML-based file covers the needs of such projects:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transfers engineering design data between producers and consumers</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provides a data format suitable for long-term data archiving.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provides a standard format for an electronic design submission.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15820" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/land-xml-20-670x1024.png" alt="buildingSMART" width="467" height="714" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/land-xml-20-670x1024.png 670w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/land-xml-20-196x300.png 196w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/land-xml-20-768x1174.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/land-xml-20-600x917.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/land-xml-20-294x450.png 294w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/land-xml-20-654x1000.png 654w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/land-xml-20.png 886w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image 4 &#8212; example from LandXML definition</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>IFC for Infrastructure</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IFC-Alignment is the first extension project aimed at providing a standardized way of communication between engineering teams in infrastructure projects. Standard BIM models were not good enough for 2D spatial alignment, while IFC-Alignment serves as a solid baseline for IFC-Road and IFC-Bridge specifications.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15822" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment1-1024x562.png" alt="IFC for Infrastructure" width="640" height="351" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment1-1024x562.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment1-300x165.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment1-768x421.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment1-600x329.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment1-450x247.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment1-1000x549.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Image 5 &#8212; IFC-Alignment</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With IFC-Alignment, the AEC industry achieved the following goals:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ability to exchange alignment information from planning and design to construction and asset management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ability to link alignment information to other project information, like cross-sections and full 3D geometry of construction elements (realized by upcoming IFC-Bridge and IFC-Road projects)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ability to query alignment information providing data like linear referencing for positioning</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ability to access open data on alignment information in asset management databases</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ability to map IFC alignment models to InfraGML (developed by OGC), and LandXML (latest InfraBIM version from buildingSMART Finland)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, IFC4, IFC-Alignment, and LandXML interoperate well. See the picture below as an example of their interoperability.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15823" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment-interop-1024x635.png" alt="buildingSMART solutions" width="640" height="397" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment-interop-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment-interop-300x186.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment-interop-768x476.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment-interop-600x372.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment-interop-450x279.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ifc-alignment-interop-1000x620.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image 6: IFC-Alignment interoperability</span></i></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIM open standards and file formats cover everything modern companies, architects, and engineers needed to design, collaborate, build, and maintain the majority of new buildings and infrastructure projects. Thus, more and more governments agencies are requiring BIM Level 3 support from the construction companies, as well as fully digitized processes based on open industry formats to develop their projects.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Year after year, </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/solutions/augmented-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">augmented reality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gradually becomes a part of our lives. Whether it is entertainment, sales, or even the military, AR solutions get increasingly versatile and effective. As technology evolves, so does the quality of these solutions. AR apps with gimmicky features that could be barely passed off as augmented reality are a thing of the past now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, AR apps transform how we solve daily issues, AR mirrors and displays serve as impactful marketing tools, and augmented reality eyewear is bound to save soldiers’ lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See the technologic wonders of modern AR in our selection.  </span></p>
<h2><b>Timberland’s AR Mirror &amp; Application Tandem</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everybody likes dressing rooms, but most people will play a game or try something exciting and new. Timberland knew this well. The company put an AR mirror on selected storefronts to drive foot traffic. A Timberland employee would use an accompanying AR application to create a virtual copy of a customer, which they can dress up using gestures (enabled by Kinect technology) to see how items fit — without entering the store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of AR mirror and application sounds overly complex as something you would casually stop by at the mall. Still, the people liked it: they engagingly dressed their virtual copies and enjoyed it as a game, prompting other people to join. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See the video below.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5TZmQPdhpak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><b>Streem AR App for Remote Maintenance</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streem shows how effective even the simplest AR apps can be in solving critical issues. In this case, fixing home appliances. For example, your dishwasher stopped working in the middle of the workweek. You contact a repair services provider, and they establish a video chat in Streem with a repair expert. As you show your appliance, the repair professional uses the AR app to pre-evaluate the problem with a range of tools: arrows, annotations, and laser pointer. They can also use Streem to record the video, take pictures, communicate with you directly, and give a quote. As a result, the service expert will arrive prepared and with the right set of tools, saving them a lot of time and effort. For the customer, Streem removes a lot stress or allows to fix the problem remotely with the expert in short notice, if possible.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/236002698?dnt=1&#038;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" title="Streem - Intro Video" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streem partners with HomeAdvisor and works with a great many professional companies in the US. The creators claim the potential of their AR app is limitless and goes beyond fixing home appliances, mentioning chefs training home cooks as an example. The application uses both Apple ARKit and Google ARCore.</span></p>
<h2><b>AR Eyepiece for the US Army Soldiers</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States Army is developing an equipment suite for soldiers with an AR eyepiece at its core. Called Tactical Augmented Reality (TAR), the device helps soldiers locate the positions of foes and squadmates, significantly improving situational awareness and thus safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eyepiece is paired with a soldier’s waist tablet and connected to thermal site on their weapon. When a soldier points the weapon, they can see the image of the target and details like distance to it with the AR eyepiece. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x8p19j8C6VI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AR-driven equipment suite is bound to become a universal tool for soldiers, replacing night-vision goggles, as well as the handheld GPS system American soldiers use to approximate their positions. Other possibilities would follow suite. For example, the waist tablets could monitor healthcare conditions of squadmates and then display it on a soldier’s eyepiece when any squadmate is in sight. Or, the device could simply provide navigational tips in unknown terrain right before soldiers’ eyes.</span></p>
<h2><b>Lacoste AR App</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legendary apparel retailer was looking for a way to promote their new LCST shoe, created for a younger audience living in urban areas. Augmented reality seemed a fitting option for our tech-savvy times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember Converse’s pioneering </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/top-ten-ar-apps-history-mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sampler app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allowed users to try new shoes on by using their smartphone cameras? Lacoste was inspired by the concept, elevating it several steps higher. With their AR app, a user points the smartphone camera to their feet and browses available modifications in the same way, but the space around the shoe is also augmented with crisp and colorful backgrounds that change with the modification. In short, the app is simple but visually stunning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See the video below.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JcMOyMudH88?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aiming to bring more color to the image of their new product, the Lacoste AR app proved to be a success, engaging as much as 30,000 users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying shoes on wasn’t the only feature still. With AR experience involving window displays, in-store signage, and promotional postcards, Lacoste has given a lesson on how to create impactful AR mobile apps.</span></p>
<h2><b>Pepsi Max and AR Display Stunt</b></h2>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Go9rf9GmYpM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commute is not the most memorable part of the day. That is until you encounter aliens, tigers, and monstrous tentacles that snatch passerby while you wait for your morning bus. These and other surprises were part of Pepsi’s fresh and exciting marketing stunt in London. The beverage brand installed an AR display in one of the bus stops, which displayed a number of high-quality visuals that gradually caught the attention commuters, taking them by surprise. In a spot-on decision, Pepsi took the premise of simple AR applications and to took it to a bigger scale and screen. The result is a morning to remember for people and a successful marketing move for the company.  </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech enthusiasts and people working in the tech industry have waited four long years for Magic Leap glasses and technology to arrive. From the first teaser, the company promised the most immersive AR/VR experience of them all, whether it was for entertainment or business purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company postponed it multiple times, but the Magic Leap glasses release finally happened on August 8 in selected areas in the US. Intellectsoft was very eager to try and test the device, the experts from the </span><a href="https://ar.intellectsoft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft AR Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more than anybody else in the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to Magic Leap, the Lab closely explored AR use cases in </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/ar-construction?_ga=2.106951427.1678694561.1535365911-967186398.1504014621" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the construction industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, launched MEP Layout demo for Microsoft HoloLens named “<a href="https://ar.intellectsoft.net/kado-framework-augmented-reality">KADO</a>,” and now creates and experiments with solutions for manufacturing, construction, and field works operations for the existing customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, it was the Lab’s time to try the new, much-anticipated device. When Magic Leap Creator Edition arrived at our San Francisco office, we were enthusiastic to discover what it can bring to our toolset, and what capabilities we could get from it to deliver better solutions to our industrial clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was the device worth the wait? Or are there too many downsides to consider investing in it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go through the pros and cons in our Magic Leap review. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>1. Two sizes complicate the purchase, development, and testing processes</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5256" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-the-Box-1024x768.jpg" alt="Magic Leap technology" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-the-Box-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-the-Box-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-the-Box-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-the-Box-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-the-Box-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/In-the-Box-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got our pair of Magic Leap glasses from Enjoy courier, who informed us we need to select between two sizes, simply called Size 1 and Size 2. What’s the difference? Your choice will depend on your interpupillary distance. We made measurements for the four members of our team: Size 2 suited the majority well (3 vs. 1), so we opted for it. As far as I know, this size should fit 30% of users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We plan to use the Magic Leap technology to develop AR demos, so choosing between two sizes creates several issues. First, AR Lab’s team is a distributed one, and it will be costly to supply each location we operate at with Magic Leap glasses, more so in two sizes. Consequently, this means we won’t be able to provide the most comfortable demo showcasing experience for each and every one of our clients.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>2. Eyes — Magic Leap glasses level should be aligned perfectly</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5257" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Wearing-ML-768x1024.jpg" alt="Magic leap glasses" width="492" height="656" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Wearing-ML-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Wearing-ML-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Wearing-ML-600x800.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Wearing-ML-338x450.jpg 338w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Wearing-ML-750x1000.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the fitting process, we also learnt that eyes and the glasses need to be aligned almost </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perfectly, because otherwise you wouldn’t finish the eye calibration. If you won’t, you get a suboptimal experience. To add to that, Magic Leap glasses come with </span><b>five different nose pad sizes,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I often find myself jumping between sizes 2, 3, 4 or 5 after I pass them to someone else.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5258" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nose-pads-1024x768.jpg" alt="Augmented reality magic leap" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nose-pads-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nose-pads-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nose-pads-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nose-pads-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nose-pads-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Nose-pads-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, this adds friction to the experience. This is acceptable when you use Magic Leap as a personal device, but not convenient for development and testing purposes while operating in a team. The lack of available apps and experiences shows that Magic Leap glasses and technology need at least one more year in the creator/developer stage before individual consumers start adopting them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>3. Magic Leap glasses have a bigger field of view than Microsoft HoloLens</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5259" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hand-Holding-Glasses-1024x768.jpg" alt="magic leap ar" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hand-Holding-Glasses-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hand-Holding-Glasses-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hand-Holding-Glasses-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hand-Holding-Glasses-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hand-Holding-Glasses-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hand-Holding-Glasses-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the first glance, you can see that Magic Leap has more active area than HoloLens, the only device close to it by capabilities. This is a major benefit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic Leap’s higher field of view allows you to observe bigger spaces with less head movements and simplifies the onboarding process for new customers. HoloLens, on the other hand, has a small field of view, which is a concern to many users, as they think it is a critical limitation, and that Microsoft’s technology is not ready for proof of concepts and pilot deployments yet. Magic Leap has addressed this concern and will yield a much better response from early adopters, whether it’s a user or a tech department. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>4. Lighter on your head</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another strength of Magic Leap is weight, the glasses are much lighter than HoloLens. This enables companies to prolong processes like collaborative design or 3D modeling — a major advantage in the enterprise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>5. More computing power, RAM, and storage space is a big advantage</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5261" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lightwear-1024x768.jpg" alt="How does magic leap work" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lightwear-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lightwear-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lightwear-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lightwear-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lightwear-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lightwear-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic Leap glasses are running on NVidia Tegra X2 chip that features an integrated 256-core NVidia Pascal GPU, a hex-core ARMv8 64-bit CPU complex, and 8GB of LPDDR4 memory with a 128-bit interface. Half of the memory (4Gb) will be available for developer applications. Storage capacity is 128GB, with 95GB available for developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this is encapsulated in a separate device called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightpack</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the user should carrier around with the glasses. It’s small and can be easily fastened to a pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such hardware is another substantial advantage — developers can work with bigger and more complex models.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>6. Magic Leap technology: localization, tracking, and scene recognition need to be improved</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the process of our Magic Leap review, I noticed more visual jittering than with HoloLens. Space-matching also doesn’t work properly, and every time I start Magic Leap after a reboot, it can&#8217;t match the room. This problem persists with feature-rich surfaces and on bigger spatial distances regardless of the effort you put in. Consequently, SLAM is always challenging. This is a software issue, and I hope the developers are already fixing it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>7. Limited use of mesh of the room</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5262" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mesh-1024x768.jpg" alt="Magic leap ar glasses" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mesh-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mesh-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mesh-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mesh-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mesh-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mesh-1000x750.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mesh.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic Leap glasses have all capabilities to scan a room, and constantly perform the scanning. However, I found that the device’s Lumin OS doesn’t use it extensively for system interfaces. You can see how a system menu goes through walls, or you can position app screens behind a wall or through the floor. In my opinion, a spatial computer interface should be constantly aware about the user’s surroundings and merge physical and digital worlds in a consistent and valid way. My guess is that this process is just too computationally heavy, and that the developers decided to optimize it and add more space-aware features later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>8. Controller trackpad navigation is odd</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5264" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8381-1024x768.jpg" alt="Magic leap augmented reality glasses" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8381-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8381-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8381-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8381-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8381-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8381-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5265" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8414-1024x768.jpg" alt="Magic leap ar glasses" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8414-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8414-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8414-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8414-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8414-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8414-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was surprised that Magic Leap’s user experience doesn’t involve gestures or gaze control at all. Instead, the company implemented trackpad-based navigation: you need to swipe the controller’s trackpad with your thumb to move the focus between UI elements. I think that gesture-based navigation that we saw in major VR headsets like Oculus Go and Google Daydream would be more fitting and comfortable in the enterprise and in general. The gaze-based approach in HoloLens is also better for UI navigation and text input. Our Magic Leap review took place in a relatively spacious office, but using the controller in tight spaces, for example on construction sites, will be uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, this is also a software issue that can be fixed. Given its importance, I think we might except the fixes soon. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>9. Voice interface and guidance are underutilized</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, voice use is very rudimentary in the native Magic Leap UI. Guidance is mostly given via text and images instead of voice. Again, most VR and AR experiences today rely on voice, and it is naturally more comfortable to have voice guidance rather than read long texts on AR glasses, no matter how well-made they are or how big is the field of view. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5266" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-from-the-back-1024x768.jpg" alt="How magic leap works" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-from-the-back-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-from-the-back-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-from-the-back-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-from-the-back-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-from-the-back-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-from-the-back-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>10. Power off complications</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic Leap glasses don’t have sleep mode — you need to turn it off correctly every time to save battery life. This comes as a very strange technical decision in a time when laptop and smartphone producers have long saved their users from this small chore. Sleep mode has become a must a long time ago, as far as technology goes at least. Although Magic Leap glasses and technology have enough to boast, the developers should definitely include this feature in the nearest future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>11. Magic Leap technology supports Mac development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers on Mac will be extremely happy: Magic Leap supports the development toolchain for Mac users, and their AR creative efforts are no longer solely locked in the Windows realm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5267" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Men-and-Magic-Leap-1024x768.jpg" alt="magic leap glasses release" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Men-and-Magic-Leap-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Men-and-Magic-Leap-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Men-and-Magic-Leap-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Men-and-Magic-Leap-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Men-and-Magic-Leap-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Men-and-Magic-Leap-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>12. No easy way to carry Magic Leap glasses around</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost any modern gadget would fit into a regular backpack and doesn&#8217;t need special protection, but this is not the case with Magic Leap. The device is fragile, and you also cannot disconnect the Lightwear computer from it. Moreover, you need additional space for the nose pads, charger, and controller. It looks like you need a seperate box to carry everything around, if you don’t want to break it on the road to a crucial meeting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5268" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-on-a-person-1024x768.jpg" alt="magic leap glasses review" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-on-a-person-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-on-a-person-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-on-a-person-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-on-a-person-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-on-a-person-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/ML-on-a-person-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>13. Excessive heat on the forehead is a major downside</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After about 15-20 minutes of usage, you can feel the heat from the glasses on your forehead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This negates the positive effect of its lightness, as well as discourages you to use it for a long period of time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>14. Magic Leap AR glasses don’t fit on vision-correction glasses</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people on our team wear glasses for vision correction. To use Magic Leap comfortably, we need to switch to contact lenses every time. I also tried to use the device while wearing my glasses, but the user experience suffered from it significantly. </span></p>
<h2><b>Magic Leap Review: Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the evident downsides, Magic Leap is a step towards true spatial AR glasses. The device is lightweight, offers a big field of view, and has enough processing power to help creators and developers build new and unique experiences. On a bigger scale, Magic Leap AR glasses are more of a step than a leap to creating new, innovative projects that would facilitate mass AR adoption, but a sufficient one nonetheless. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For our enterprise customers, Magic Leap provides an opportunity to effectively experiment with larger BIM models in manufacturing and construction. Entertainment and education are other spaces where I see the opportunity to make proof of concepts and test the device for real world applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, this is a solid start for Magic Leap, and Intellectsoft AR Lab is anticipating new updates, fixes, and improvements that would elevate the device further.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Boeing to DHL to Xerox, augmented reality (AR) has already been solving long-standing issues for enterprises across industries. Other companies follow suit with their efforts, trying to figure out whether AR can also impact their operations effectively.</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, AR hasn’t become ubiquitous yet. There is no tried-and-true roadmap for a given industry or operation at the moment. Therefore, if you are considering to implement augmented reality technology in your business, you will need answers to a long list of questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intellectsoft</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has you covered with an assessment of Harvard Business Review’s “A Manager’s Guide to Augmented Reality.” We will mostly be reviewing the guide’s cornerstone, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Every Organization Needs an Augmented Reality Strategy,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” an article by Michael E. Porter and James E. Heppelmann that is to the point and full of real-life use cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singling out the most essential pieces of information, and providing analysis along the way, our review covers the following ground:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is AR</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ways it elevates operations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How AR creates value</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing examples across industries</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to build an AR strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to start deploying</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s discover the full potential of the ground-breaking technology, and how you can start implementing it in your enterprise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>How Augmented Reality Works</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR is a set of technologies that superimposes digital data on the physical world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An AR experience starts with a camera-equipped device — a smartphone, a tablet, or augmented reality smart glasses or headset (ODG R7 or Microsoft HoloLens respectively), each equipped with AR software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a common AR experience:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A user points an AR-enabled device at an object</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software scans it using computer vision technology, analysing the video stream</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The device downloads the information about the object from the cloud, like a web browser loads a page via a URL  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR provides a view of real-time data about an object, allows a user to control it with a touchscreen, voice, or gestures.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to relaying it to the user, AR software gets up-to-date information on the objects from their digital twins, which are stored in the cloud. Digital twin technology uses computer-aided design (usually, on the product development stage) or digitalises physical objects to provide or extract that information. For this data to be comprehensive, digital twins also gather it from enterprise business systems and external sources, like third-party software of a vendor (read our article about </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/advanced-imaging-algorithms-for-digital-twin-reconstruction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital twin technology in construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn more).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>New Information-Delivery Paradigm</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors of the augmented reality guide argue that AR allows for transforming how we structure, manage, and deliver data on the internet. The technology helps solve an issue everyone is familiar with: to use 2-D information we found on the web in the real world, we have to mentally translate it for use in a 3-D world. The best example is fixing something using a manual: one always has to shift between the object and the manual, which at the very least leads to quick mental exhaustion. In short, it is simply inefficient. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of an AR heads-up display</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5212" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/AR-Post-Pic-Heads-Up-Displays.png" alt="augmented reality smart glasses" width="850" height="472" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/AR-Post-Pic-Heads-Up-Displays.png 850w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/AR-Post-Pic-Heads-Up-Displays-300x167.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/AR-Post-Pic-Heads-Up-Displays-768x426.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/AR-Post-Pic-Heads-Up-Displays-600x333.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/AR-Post-Pic-Heads-Up-Displays-450x250.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an AR smartphone or tablet app won’t make this and similar processes significantly easier, augmented reality smart glasses will. The guide also mentions heads-up displays which come in, for example, AR windshields that provide GPS navigation and other important information to drivers with zero-to-none distractions. Such displays are already available in dozens of car models. The industrial impact of AR displays in general is bigger still.</span></p>
<h2><b>Case #1: Newport News Shipbuilding</b></h2>
<p><b>Process</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Final inspection in ship construction; marking steel structures that are not part of the finished carrier in AR</span></p>
<p><b>Issue</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Builders needed to constantly consult complex 2-D blueprints</span></p>
<p><b>Device</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Dedicated headset</span></p>
<p><b>AR’s Impact</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Inspection time reduced by 96% (from 36 hours to 90 minutes)</span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Key Capabilities of AR</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abundantly detailing practical uses of augmented reality, Porter and Heppelmann list AR features that significantly elevate the process where the technology is applied.</span></p>
<h2><strong>1.</strong><b>Visualisation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR software and devices allow the user to see internal features of an object or individual in a fashion of X-ray vision.</span></p>
<h2><b>Case #2: AccuVein, medical device company</b></h2>
<p><b>Process</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Vascular procedures like blood draws</span></p>
<p><b>AR Solution:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AR converts the heat signature of a patient’s veins into an image that is superimposed on the skin, making the veins easier for doctors to locate</span></p>
<p><b>Device</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Dedicated headset</span></p>
<p><b>AR’s Impact</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Reduces escalations (for example, calling for assistance) by 45%; triples the likelihood of successful needlestick on the first try</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5219 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1073722691-1.jpg" alt="augmented reality for organizations" width="1000" height="669" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1073722691-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1073722691-1-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1073722691-1-768x514.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1073722691-1-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1073722691-1-450x301.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>2. Instruction and guidance</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR provides real-time, on the spot, and step-by-step visual guidance on tasks like assembly, machine operation, and warehouse picking. The information is presented on a display or in interactive 3-D holograms that walk the user through a process. This increases efficiency, speed, precision, and lowers costs for any operation all at once.</span></p>
<h2><b>Case #3: Boeing</b></h2>
<p><b>Process</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Aircraft assembly</span></p>
<p><b>AR Solution:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 50-step AR training for wing assembly (30 parts)</span></p>
<p><b>Device</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Dedicated headset</span></p>
<p><b>AR’s Impact</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: 35% less time spent compared to using drawings and documentation; number of trainees with little or no experience who can perform the task correctly for the first time increased by 90%</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>3. Interaction</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile devices and smart apps have been gradually replacing our usual, physical means of controlling objects — button, knobs, even built-in touch screens. AR contributes to further transformation of these interactions. Comprehensive AR interfaces will be superimposed on products and used with AR headsets along with hand gestures and voice commands. For example, a factory employee would walk past machines on a manufacturing line, see their performance statistics, and make adjustments without physically interacting with them. The capability is nascent, but there solid examples exist.  </span></p>
<h2><b>Case #4: GE</b></h2>
<p><b>Process</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Turbine wiring</span></p>
<p><b>AR Solution:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Voice-command AR experience</span></p>
<p><b>Device</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Dedicated headset</span></p>
<p><b>AR’s Impact</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: 34% productivity increase</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>The Value of Augmented Reality for Organizations </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter and Heppelmann write that AR creates business value in two ways: AR as a product feature and AR solutions in the value chain across industries. The latter gets significantly more coverage. The reason isn’t hard to pin down: enterprises are more interested in custom AR solutions that are built to solve their specific goals and go a long way. Compared to implementation of other technologies across branched enterprise infrastructures, AR solutions show impactful results in short term. The benefits of augmented reality are clear, supplied with impressive metrics and positive feedback from employees. When it comes to business, AR is a very comfortable technology: even if you invest a lot in it, you see the return on that investment very quickly. The aforementioned Boeing is a prominent example, as this video </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTblKJjTadQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, AR as a feature has a secondary priority in the enterprise. As of today, there are only a few exceptions. The guide mentions that heads-up displays have been a key feature in fighter jets, which are in the elite military products niche, as well as commercial aircrafts. Meantime, the automotive industry only started supplying the latest vehicle models with these displays. They have yet to become cost-effective so much so that a company like DHL would invest in installing them into delivery vehicles. As of now, companies start with AR in operations of higher priority (for DHL it is logistics, a case we will look at further).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, AR as a feature will continue to create additional value in industries like education (for example visualising human body or planets with apps) and entertainment (AR games or installation on events). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s take a look at how AR helps across the value chain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Product Development </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to AR, engineers, designers, and architects had to use computer-aided design (CAD) tools to create a product model. Conceptualising those designs in full proved constraining on computer screens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augmented reality technology allows them to:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superimpose 3-D models they created on the physical world as holograms. This unties the creator’s hands, allowing them to significantly improve and evaluate a design.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superimpose 3-D models on physical prototypes to see how well do they match.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b><i>Quick Use Case</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Volkswagen use this tool to check alignment in digital design reviews, which improved the efficiency of the process and made it five to ten times faster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Manufacturing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of manufacturing processes are complex, and a mistake is often costly. Augmented reality for organizations that rely on assembly lines helps to address these challenges:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivers the right information in the moment when it’s needed on the line</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Captures information from from automation and control systems, secondary sensors, and asset management systems, and delivers monitoring and diagnostic data to an AR-enabled device of a factory employee. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><b><i>Quick Use Case</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Iconics, who specialise in automation software for factories and buildings, has began to integrate AR into their products and user interfaces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Logistics</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guide’s authors point out that workers in most warehouses still consult paper lists to collect things and search for them. Slow and error-prone, the picking process amounts to up to 65% of warehouse costs in logistics. </span></p>
<p><b>DHL</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> addresses this challenge by providing the workers with AR instructions that direct them to the location of an item and the best root to it. The result is fewer errors, higher worker engagement, and a 25% productivity gain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR helped </span><b>Intel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reduce picking time by 29%, as the error rate fell to almost zero. The solution also allowed new Intel workers immediately achieve the required picking speed 15% faster than  compared to traditional training. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5220" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1034785948-1.jpg" alt="augmented reality technology" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1034785948-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1034785948-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1034785948-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1034785948-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1034785948-1-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3></h3>
<h2><b>Marketing &amp; Sales</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR solves a long-standing problem for businesses and their customers, allowing the latter to view what they are planning to buy in a real setting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR brings even more impactful benefits to marketing and sales:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More accurate expectations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More confidence about purchase decisions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greater product satisfaction</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduces the need for showrooms (Gap has already created an </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/top-ten-ar-apps-history-mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR showroom app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Quick Use Case</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: IKEA offers an app that allows the customers to see how products fit their home setting. The company also uses the app to collect crucial information about product preferences in different regions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>After-sales Service</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this step of the value chain, the future of augmented reality is also bright. The technology can show factory workers predictive analytics data generated by a product, guide them through repairs in real-time, and connect them to remote experts who would provide help conveniently and quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><b>Xerox</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initially used AR to connect field engineers with experts, replacing telephone support and service manuals. As a result, first-time fix rates increased by 67% and an engineer’s efficiency by 20%. Additionally, the average time it took to solve the issue dropped by two hours, lowering the need for staffing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xerox then took AR to the next level, and now connects the engineers directly with customers. With customer satisfaction rates rising to 95%, the company also increased the rate at which customers resolve issues without on-site help by 76%, cutting travel costs for Xerox and downtime for their customers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Augmented Reality Strategy — Q&amp;A</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guide outlines five spot-on questions you need to ask to start with your augmented reality strategy.</span></p>
<p><b>What is the range of AR opportunities in the industry, and in what sequence should they be pursued?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies should begin with weighing on the technology’s potential impact on customers/employees, product capabilities, and the value chain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How will AR reinforce a company’s product differentiation? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR can extend product capabilities through companion experiences (like step-by-step guides or pre-recorded holograms), give more information, and increase product loyalty. AR can also differentiate your product by providing an interface that extends product functionality or makes it easier to use. In turn, such an interface will improve product service, support, and uptime. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right differentiation would ultimately depend on your existing strategy, the strategies of your competitors, as well as the advent of AR itself.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Where will AR have the greatest impact on cost reduction?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, you can significantly lower costs in manufacturing, product design, service, and training. Still, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t research how AR can improve other operations in your business. After all, the parts of the value chain mentioned above win from AR almost immediately. Other industries and operations can benefit from the technology not from the very start, for example </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/ar-solutions-for-construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the construction industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The authors also underline that each company will need to align AR-driven cost-reduction with its strategic positioning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Should you invest into in-house AR capabilities, or wll outsourcing or partnering be sufficient?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors reckon that a company needs to build their own AR team if the technology is essential to their competitive advantage. In other cases, starting with outsourcing or finding an AR partner will suffice.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, outsourcing is a better option: building the full set of AR capabilities is challenging, and takes a significant amount of time and costs. More so, specialization emerges almost at every turn, while AR talent is in short supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, as AR vendors focus solely on the technology, they will compete between each other, constantly raising the bar on the quality of their offerings. In-house departments will have a hard time chasing after them due to the limited focus and tasks and, possibly, experimentation space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the authors expect that companies will eventually create AR teams to work in-house, just as every business did in the 1990s and 2000s with teams that build and run websites.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How will AR change communications with stakeholders?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR can complement the existing print and 2-D digital communication and has a huge potential to replace it completely. For example, stakeholders will put on augmented reality smart glasses for video calls instead of using laptops or smartphones, which introduces more flexibility and opportunities to cut costs. The authors also think that AR will fundamentally transform communication, comparing it to the internet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Deploying AR — Q&amp;A</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The augmented reality guide lists five questions organizations need to address when implementing AR.</span></p>
<p><b>Which development capabilities will be required?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an AR app like the aforementioned IKEA catalogue application is relatively easy. You will need mobile app development services with AR capabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need an instructions solutions like the one Boeing uses, you will need AR experts that can create and maintain dynamic 3-D digital content and have experience building solutions for AR headsets (like Microsoft HoloLens) or glasses (ODG R7).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want greater value through an interactive experience, you need AR experts that work with voice recognition and gestures and know how to integrate the solution with software that controls secure copy protocols (SCPs). Here, the abilities mentioned in the case above are also important.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How should companies create digital content for AR solutions?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. In the case of the most basic AR solution, the existing content can be repurposed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. For simple applications like an AR catalogue, you need to create only basic product representations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Instruction applications for tasks like machine repair require highly detailed product representations (digital twins). A company can create them by adapting CAD models or using 3-D scanning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How will AR applications recognize the physical environment?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There several ways the technology can recognize a physical environment.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unregistered AR experience</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> determines the location of an AR device with, for example, GPS to display relevant information about that location without anchoring it to an object. Vehicle heads-up display work this way.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registered AR experience</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anchors information to an object through markers like barcodes, logos, or labels, which can be scanned with an AR device. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another version of this experience</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recognizes an object by comparing its shapes to a catalogues of 3-D models.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What AR hardware is required?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR experiences for big consumer audiences commonly involve </span><b>smartphones</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while companies use </span><b>tablets</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to leverage bigger screens and more processing and graphic power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more powerful and comprehensive contextual experiences, industries like automotive and military use </span><b>heads-up displays</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the guide mentions </span><b>AR headsets and glasses as devices</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will be most common in the enterprise when they become more affordable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for augmented reality strategy and hardware, most companies should take a </span><b>cross-platform approach</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows for deploying different smartphone and tablet brands and ensures the company will be ready to deploy the headsets or glasses in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Should you use a software development or a content-publishing model?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are planning to create an AR experience that would serve a number of purposes for a limited time (for example, an event app), and you don’t plan to change its digital content, the software development model is your option. Still, you should note that, in order to change the digital content, developers would need to rewrite the entire app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need it the other way around, the content-publishing model allows to create AR content and store it in the cloud. This option enables you to change the content without changing the software, as well as makes the content available across the organization. In other words, this is your cloud word processor, only for AR content. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Palo Alto, California, May 22, 2018</strong> — Intellectsoft, a full-cycle software development company with a strong focus on emerging technologies, has officially announced the launch of the AR Lab — a development unit focused on augmented reality solutions, primarily for the construction industry. As a part of Intellectsoft Group, the lab consolidates over two years AR research and development and will help engineering companies achieve digital transformation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2007, Intellectsoft has been developing enterprise software solutions, constantly identifying emerging technologies that will substantially elevate key enterprise operations of its clients. In the recent years, the company has been doing research and development work in the field of AR, identifying that the technology unlocks new levels of efficiency, precision, speed, and comfort to industries where engineering and industrial design play a key role. Over this time, Intellectsoft’s AR experts, who form the newly established lab, have developed KADO — an actionable technology framework for the construction industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having recognised on early development stages that KADO and AR hold immense potential, Intellectsoft has decided to create a stand-alone development laboratory. The AR Lab will help the architecture, engineering, and construction companies successfully transform their operations with AR, using the KADO technology framework. The lab’s team will also continue to expand the functionality of the framework to add new solutions, as well as extend its potential to new industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“Though AR is still in its young years, the technology is up and running at companies like Boeing, Porsche, and Ford. AR has transformed their key operations almost overnight, bringing tangible results and business value almost immediately. This is exactly what we are eager to bring to our clients with KADO and the AR Lab,” says Alexander Skalabanov, CEO of Intellectsoft.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pavlo Bashmakov, who took a pivotal part in the development of KADO, was appointed the Head of the Lab. His extensive experience in software engineering and delivering enterprise solutions with advanced technologies will help the Lab achieve its goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“In terms of bringing practical value and solving long-standing problems across industries, augmented reality is the most promising enterprise technology right now,” says Pavlo Bashmakov. “With Intellectsoft’s infrastructure, technological expertise, and deep enterprise development background, we will help our clients create advanced AR solutions that will solve their crucial issues in a practical and comfortable transformation.”</em></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Intellectsoft had participated in two distinctive events — Dev_At_Work in New York and the annual IT Forum in Kyiv. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) were in the spotlight at both gatherings. Putting these technologies into the current-day context, we now look </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">back at their overlapping history &#8212; to gain a perspective on how they would change our future.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There was still a lot of doubt about augmented reality and virtual reality technology in 2017, even in the clean air of Silicon Valley streets. On Google Agency Day in NYC, Aaron Luber (a VP at Google responsible for the Daydream VR headset) said that one of the most frequently asked questions he gets is, “Did we miss the train on VR and AR?” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His answer — no —  is being backed up by a wide array of companies, mostly in retail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other industries are understandably cautious. Both technologies were created as far back as the 1960’s and have only begun making noise recently. Still, companies start realising the benefits of augmented reality technology, as well as VR. Earlier, BMW announced their AR </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retail app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows users to showcase cars in real size anywhere, and </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/two-m-commerce-technologies-set-change-industry-year" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> infused its shopping experiences with both VR and AR. More so, these technologies were put to use by the likes of </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/two-m-commerce-technologies-set-change-industry-year" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IKEA and Converse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retails apps</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning of the 2010’s, and are more familiar to everyone than they appear. The future of virtual reality technology, as well as AR, is hidden in the past.</span></p>
<h2><b>The History of Augmented and Virtual Reality Technology</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1962, Mortin Heilig decided to change the movie-going experience and created “Sensorama” — an early example of multisensory technology in a machine that showed 3D films in stereo and dispersed aromas at certain moments. This was the earliest prototype of virtual reality technology, and now it is bringing spectacle to our daily activities as much as it is changing the entertainment business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See the video:</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Ivan Sutherland - Head Mounted Display" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NtwZXGprxag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was not the only one contributing to this technologic shift at that time. In 1968, eminent computer scientist Ivan Sutherland built “The Sword of Damocles,” an experimental head mounted display that was the precursor of both augmented reality technology and VR. In the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small clip</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that sees the scientist showcasing his invention, the display looks surreal and unwieldy, but without it Amazon Go, AR-based </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mcommerce services, and other existing business use cases for augmented reality technology </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would not have existed. </span></p>
<h2><b>A Different Kind of Past of VR and AR</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses are always cautious when it comes to major change, so it is no wonder they were worried about these technologies and bid their time until VR and AR started becoming business and </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/two-m-commerce-technologies-set-change-industry-year" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mcommerce trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Virtual reality is a groundbreaking technology that will transform many industries. Still, for a long time it existed only in popular culture fiction, not the real world. Augmented reality technology is different. Upon closer examination, it turns out that its core promise is not only familiar, but used by business everywhere. The promise of the technology used in augmented reality was there for decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s explore the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, reality is an experience, and this experience is relative. In some cases, it can be changed by adding — or “augmenting” — different physical elements and layers to the existing physical reality, changing it to a certain extent. When it comes to business, this means creating a user experience that, like augmented reality technology, slightly changes the reality by “augmentation” of certain elements &#8212; like aromas and lighting.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/ecommerce-retail" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">retail industry</a> has been using this “augmentation” for years. In the US, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch “augmented” their in-store experience with loud music, recognizable aroma, and low lighting to create a user experience that resembles a teenager’s room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another bright example is the jewelry industry. Most of the jewelry houses have glaring lighting. The idea is as simple as it is ingenious: the natural gleam of diamonds is amplified with the help of brighter lighting to create and sustain a sense of wealth and prosperity. One of the industry’s top publications even noted that jewelry stores shouldn’t regard lighting as an expense, as it increases sales and profitability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, no smartphones and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retails apps</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are involved in these examples, and, from a certain perspective, these were the first business use cases for augmented reality technology.</span></p>
<h2><b>Future of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Technology</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2000’s, businesses gave a cold welcome to ecommerce; and although a smartphone had become an </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/no-iphones-arent-luxury-items-theyre-economic-necessities/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">economic necessity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017, companies were only starting to embrace mobile in full that year.
