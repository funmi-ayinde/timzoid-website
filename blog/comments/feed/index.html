					<description><![CDATA[Hey, everyone! I was having a hard time choosing a good backend service for my apps, so just wanted to share my experience with you on that. Having some apps both at Google Play and Appstore, I used Parse until Facebook decided to shut it down. So, I was forced to search for alternatives and, to be honest, was not that happy as most of them didn&#039;t fit my requirements as nicely. 
Firstly, I checked Firebase, but it&#039;s very limited in querying and indexing working on a nonSQL ecosystem with the database being a giant JSON doc. Then, it was AWS and Appery, both are not user-friendly and become rather expensive in no time. My next try was Kinvey, and it&#039;s super expensive once you start doing something complex. I needed system to support social login, like Facebook, Twitter, Google, geolocation, and push notifications for both iOS and Android, so my final try was Backednless, I started for free and was able to figure out how to use it a lot faster than before, since support is pretty fast to answer. So far, it fits all of my needs and functionality is on point. Hope this helped.]]></description>
