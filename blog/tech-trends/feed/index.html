</ol>
<h1>What is serverless?</h1>
<p>As it is with any new innovation, there is no versatile definition that works for everybody. In the case of serverless, it’s even more real because the concept has developed in a relatively short time. And still, lots of people confuse it with other concepts. Here’s the broad, yet the simple definition of “serverless” we think fits it the best:</p>
<blockquote><p>Serverless is a paradigm of executing applications in cloud-native environments that influences the way applications are built and deployed and makes use of cloud-computing advantages.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simon Wardley, a “serverless” advocate, <a href="https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1073379461473730560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defines</a> it as:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[Serverless is] an event-driven, utility-based, stateless, code execution environment in which you write code and consume services.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>A couple of words on What Serverless is NOT:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>It’s not a container. </b>“A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. Available for both Linux and Windows based apps, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the environment. Containers isolate software from its surroundings, for example, differences between development and staging environments and help reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure,” — shares <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker.com;</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>It’s not a PaaS.</b> Unlike serverless, PaaS refers to a system where there is more (compared to serverless) control over deployment environment; applications take a while to spin up; applications need to be configured to scale automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18782" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676.jpeg" alt="girl works with panoramic view" width="2247" height="1500" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676.jpeg 2247w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-1024x684.jpeg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-2048x1367.jpeg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-600x401.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-1000x668.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2247px) 100vw, 2247px" /></p>
<p>In many sources, you can also find that serverless architecture also means <b>“managed services that scale to zero.”</b> That’s why the scale-to-zero approach or pay for the consumption of computing resources (instead of allocation) is a key concept of the serverless. Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2>Scaling to zero as the main concept</h2>
<p>&#8220;Scale to zero&#8221; stops consuming resources when there are no requests. Therefore, computation resources become consumed when in use. Serverless cloud providers automatically scale out the application to handle the increased load.</p>
<p>It reduces the overall costs because <b>customers are only billed for the time that the application is running.</b> It’s also known as pay-per-use (pay for consumption and not for allocation). That’s why scale-to-zero is appropriately seen as the main concept of serverless computing.</p>
<h2>Functions as code</h2>
<p>Serverless is frequently used in conjunction with a <b>function-as-a-service (FaaS)</b> offering. In this case, the code is written as a function. In turn, the function acts as a small single-purpose piece of code that runs dynamically in response to some event trigger or on schedule.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that FaaS allows developers to run backend code without managing their server systems, here are some more essential aspects of it:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to language and environment, FaaS functions are regular applications, but have a range of architectural restrictions;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Using FaaS with serverless computing requires a different approach to deployment as compared to when you manage your servers. Developers upload code in a FaaS environment to the FaaS vendor who then takes over everything related to deployment. Developers don’t have to do anything;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A FaaS vendor covers all the scaling needs. Developers write a function to assume horizontal-scaled parallelism, and the FaaS vendor covers everything scaling-related from that point. Horizontal scaling is fully automated and elastic;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The FaaS provider fully manages resource provisioning and allocation.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get started with FaaS, developers simply bring their function code and wire up event triggers. This is where an event-driven architecture steps in.</p>
<h2>Events as triggers</h2>
<p>The <b>event-driven architecture (or simply EDA)</b> is a software architecture paradigm where code runs in response to events. An event means any change of state in the system, for example, a new message in a queue, the changed record in a DB, a file upload, etc.</p>
<p>Simply put, EDA promotes production, consumption, and reaction to any events. In turn, events trigger business functions or code. For example, when a consumer books a hotel room, the room&#8217;s state changes from &#8220;free&#8221; to &#8220;booked&#8221;. A hotel booking system architecture may treat this state change as an event whose occurrence can be made known to other applications within the architecture.</p>
<h2>Services are all managed</h2>
<p>In a serverless architecture, developers don’t worry about supporting any related services. Such services can include databases, storage, message queues, stream processing, caches, etc.</p>
<p>In turn, developers can connect <b>managed services</b> together, so they shouldn’t think about provisioning, maintaining, and administering these servers and systems. Also, there is no need to ensure application fault tolerance and availability. Cloud providers handle these aspects for them.</p>
<h1>What are the benefits of serverless?</h1>
<p>Before considering the serverless approach for your business, let’s take a closer look at the advantages it has.</p>
<h3><b>1 — Lower Operational Costs</b></h3>
<p>With a Serverless architecture, you pay the vendor only for resources your application consumed, meaning you do not need to allocate costs for managing your own servers, databases, and application logic.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18784" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1.jpg" alt="girls work hard to get tasks done" width="2250" height="1500" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1.jpg 2250w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" /></p>
<p>While you get the same cost reduction benefits from PaaS (platform as a service) and IaaS (infrastructure as a service), the two do not allow you to pay only for the resources you consume, making Serverless a cheaper option.</p>
<h4>Automated &amp; More Cost-Efficient Scaling</h4>
<p>Serverless comes with automatic and elastic horizontal scaling that is fully managed by the vendor. In many cases, this allows you to cut budget costs in a big way.</p>
<h4>More Optimization — Fewer Expenses</h4>
<p>With a Serverless architecture, there is a direct link between code optimization and operational costs. The more you optimize your application’s code, the less you pay.</p>
<p>Say, your app needs a second to process an event; if you reduce the time to 500 ms, you may instantly save 50% percent from what you paid for minute-long processing. The amount you save may change from vendor to vendor, but the overall picture remains the same — you can save a lot).</p>
<h3><b>2 — Simplified Operational Management</b></h3>
<p>Before starting with this section, it is essential to go back to the fact that Serverless has not matured yet, and different operational nuances will arise as you start using it. Still, that does not dismiss the significant benefits of Serverless architecture in operational management. Let’s see what they are.</p>
<h4>Next-to-no System Administration</h4>
<p>In short, an utterly serverless solution needs zero system administration. The process of packaging and deploying a FaaS function is simple compared to deploying a server — you only need to package your code into a zip file and upload it to the vendor. That’s it. More so, if you are only starting with your application, you can skip the packaging stage and write the code right to the provider’s console.</p>
<h4>More Agility</h4>
<p>The nature of Serverless allows your team to decrease time to market in a reasonable fashion. Plus, with a faster deployment time, teams can experiment with new features and see if the work quickly at a very low cost and with little friction. This, in turn, lowers the lead time and may result in a better final product.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18785" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2.jpg" alt="man looking on his roadmap" width="2250" height="1500" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2.jpg 2250w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" /></p>
<h3><b>3 — </b><b>Faster time to market</b></h3>
<p>Speed is a new big. Every one aims to get their applications to market as soon as possible. With serverless, it’s quicker and easier: no need to worry about wiring up custom components, the code is shipped many times faster, and there’s less to build from scratch. As a result, developers run deployments with less fuss.</p>
<h3><b>4 — Less Impact on Environment</b></h3>
<p>The world has seen a big spike in the number of data centers in the last ten years, which increased the amount of burnt fossil fuel significantly. Tech giants are considering building centers near renewable energy sources. Still, this will not be enough to reduce the impact due to another issue: highly inefficient capacity management.</p>
<p>According to Forbes, standard servers in organizations deliver <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/06/03/30-of-servers-are-sitting-comatose-according-to-research/#491cd25d59c7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no more than 5 to 15 percent</a> of their maximum computing output on average in a year. Serverless computing, on the other hand, frees companies from the challenging task of provisioning computing, capacity all the while allowing serverless vendors to allow just the right amount of resources for their clients, and only when they need them. So, serverless may be the one and the only solution to optimize data center resources worldwide, lowering their environmental impact dramatically.</p>
<h1>What to keep in mind if you&#8217;re considering serverless?</h1>
<p>Serverless has not matured yet, and this way of building and deploying applications has its advantages just as it has some drawbacks. There is an array of issues you need to know about before switching to this paradigm. We will take a closer look at the inherent flaws of the concept, the ones that will never be fixed entirely.</p>
<h3><b>Lack of Control</b></h3>
<p>Using Serverless means your vendor is in control of the parts of your system. This may lead to a wide variety of issues, including <b>functionality loss, forced API upgrades, system downtime</b>, and other issues that may affect your application and its users.</p>
<h3><b>Security </b></h3>
<p>Every newly emerged concept always has a list of security issues, and that’s also the case with serverless. From insecure serverless deployment configuration to inadequate monitoring and logging of functions and insecure third-party dependencies, these are some of the security issues to pay attention to before jumping in a serverless world.</p>
<h3><b>BaaS-Only Serverless Architecture Issues</b></h3>
<p>Serverless may decrease your operational resources, but not entirely. In the case of a 100% BaaS-based architecture,<b> all the logic will be in the client.</b> Backend-as-a-Service (or BaaS) is a cloud service model in which developers outsource all the behind-the-scenes aspects of a web or mobile application so that they only have to write and maintain the frontend.</p>
<p>So, for your next platforms, you will need to repeat the implementation of a subset of that logic. If you need to migrate to a new database, this will require code replication or coordination change for all of your clients. Another issue with a full BaaS architecture is that you cannot optimize your server design for client performance in no way.</p>
<p>On the bright side, if your serverless architecture uses only FaaS, these issues are non-existent.</p>
<h3><b>Technology Limitations</b></h3>
<p>Not all technologies can be used due to the scale-to-zero concept. The so-called slow <b>“cold start”</b> (first execution after scaling to zero) can lead to performance issues. Some applications require more time to start and then work fast. And for serverless fast startup time is always crucial.</p>
<h3><b>Doesn’t Suite Some Tasks</b></h3>
<p>There are some tasks where serverless is <b>worse fit than traditional models.</b> For such tasks, the usage of serverless may lead to increasing costs.</p>
<h3><b>FaaS-Only Serverless Architecture Issues</b></h3>
<p>FaaS functions have major <b>local state restrictions</b>, meaning you should not take it as given that the state from one invocation of a FaaS function will be available to another invocation of the same function.</p>
<p>If you cannot store states in memory, using a fast NoSQL database may do the trick alongside a number of other options, but all of them are significantly slower than in-memory or on-machine persistence, and the latter will not fit each and every project.</p>
<h1>The Future is Serverless</h1>
<p>It’s hard to predict where serverless computing will be a year from now. Looking back at the current state of serverless, its evolution over the last several years, how vendors address existing issues, as well as the growing community, we can expect the following developments in years to come.</p>
<p><b>Better Tooling</b>. There’s no road ahead for serverless if the existing tooling stops evolving. Luckily, Amazon and other vendors have been improving things like deployment/application bundling and configuration, and we can expect vendors in general to make improvements in other important areas, such as remote debugging and distributed monitoring.</p>
<p><b>Serverless FaaS Will Fit More Applications</b>. Serverless FaaS doesn’t have a consistent in-server state, so such an architecture will not be able to support high-throughput applications.</p>
<p>While vendors will surely try to make function instances active between events for a longer time, the hybrid approach — an architecture combining serverless and non-serverless execution models — is likely to be the better option for such applications.</p>
<p><b>Fewer implementation Issues. </b>From deployment to packaging to integration testing to the opaqueness of monitoring support, there is a very long list of issues when it comes to implementing serverless applications as of today. As vendors are gradually fixing implementation-related issues, we can expect them to deal with all the problems existing in this area today as well.</p>
<p><b>Emergence of First Solid Serverless Practices</b>. Although a lot is clear about nature serverless computing and how it can benefit teams and applications they design, it is still a very, very young field will little-to-no guidelines for the long-term as well as many blank spaces across the board.</p>
<p>So, in the next several years, we can expect the serverless rule book to start shaping up. It will outline where serverless fits best and where traditional ways are more favorable, the best ways to implement serverless, how to build a hybrid serverless architecture, and so on. The answers will come from both sides — the vendors, and the community.</p>
<p>That doesn’t end here, but vendors will surely try to tackle these first. Will serverless become the new normal for application architectures? It has the potential, but, as with many things, only time will tell.</p>
<h1>Should your business switch to serverless now?</h1>
<p>In 2017 the serverless market was worth around $3 billion. By 2025, it’s predicted to go up to $20 billion. Many giants are already adopting serverless. To name a few, Netflix, Coca Cola, Airbnb, EA, Vevo, MongoDB, Accenture, etc.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18787" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics.jpg" alt="graph for serverless stats in the usa" width="1170" height="740" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics.jpg 1170w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-1024x648.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-768x486.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-600x379.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-450x285.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-1000x632.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" />If you consider switching to serverless, we suggest keeping in mind two things:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You should not migrate all your apps to serverless right away. Try and test first;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Serverless is the right direction for the future for two main reasons: it gives the opportunity to deliver value to customers quickly and lets you pay only for the used resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, there are still numerous pitfalls and execution bottlenecks utilizing serverless. Moreover, security is one of the top issues that should be resolved over time. Yet one thing the entire market knows is that serverless is inevitable, and it will own the market. It’s all just a matter of time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The profound humanitarian fallout of the COVID-19 continues to expand by the day. Governments have launched unprecedented public-health and economic responses. Companies have developed and implemented business continuity plans, security guidance, and, most importantly — seamless remote working conditions. In this article, we offer some of Intellectsoft’s latest insights of managing a team of remote developers during times like this.</p>
<h1><b>How To Manage Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h1>
<p>So here we are, living in a world where pandemic movies came to life. The number of ill people is rising, as well as the level of stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Since March 16, our employees have been working remotely. We have already faced all the possible difficulties on our way and learned how to tackle the main challenges to manage the working process smart and effectively. We are ready to spill the beans and share all the secrets of productive remote management.</p>
<p>To stop COVID-19, all the countries around the world are trying to minimize human interactions, resulting in <strong>a staggering number of employees learning how to work remotely</strong>. Even though the majority of software engineers are not new to work like this, it can still be quite a challenge to manage a team in such difficult times psychologically.</p>

<p>That is why in this article, we are going to shed light on ten tips to organize an effective working process with remote developers, taking into account both psychological pitfalls and practical hurdles to overcome.</p>
<h2><b>How to Manage a Team of Remote Developers Despite the Uncertainty</b></h2>
<p>First and foremost, you need to outline all the possible challenges your software development team may face when working from home. Usually, it boils down to three main challenges. These are communication problems and pitfalls, lack of well-functioned equipment, and the inability to manage productivity.</p>
<p>For this reason, before setting out the rules, guidelines, and software development team goals, make sure you did your best to eliminate or alleviate the possible struggles that may occur.</p>
<h2><b>10 Tips To Keep Your Developers Team Effective During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h2>
<p>Luckily, we have already examined the best cases of smart and efficient remote developers management and prepared a quick guide for you to follow. We have taken into consideration the main challenges that can be difficult to tackle and offering comprehensive solutions to the problem. Take a look and enjoy the tips that truly work.</p>
<h3><b>1. Secure a Well-Functioned Tech Facilities and Tools</b></h3>
<p>Firstly, you need some software that will unite all the working processes. To ensure productivity, you’d better have a look at <strong>various collaboration tools perfect for a software development team working remotely.</strong>  Such tools as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/ru/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jira</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/?&amp;aceid=&amp;adposition=&amp;adgroup=77960797405&amp;campaign=1495118561&amp;creative=389415003358&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=trello&amp;matchtype=e&amp;network=g&amp;placement=&amp;ds_kids=p48956357108&amp;ds_e=GOOGLE&amp;ds_eid=700000001557344&amp;ds_e1=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Iv0BRDaARIsAGTWD1u6J2htFRXh6wNFyzNse_aL_oTmPCvKEjPuVZYAT10fuV645yZsumIaAieOEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trello</a>, <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom</a> enable us to stay focused on daily tasks, plan and manage projects. Slack helps our team to stay connected all the time. It’s the place where we <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/remote-team-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainstorm</a> and solve current issues. And Zoom, as a perfect alternative to Skype, is a way more convenient tool to have video calls and screen sharing.</p>
<p>What is more, there are tons of <a href="https://brainhub.eu/blog/tools-for-remote-development-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity tools</a> that are both efficient and have friendly interfaces like Todoist, iDoneThis, and Atlassian Stash. With the help of such systems, it is much easier to have an overall picture needed when working remotely.</p>
<h3><b>2. Make Sure Your Staff Have Everything for Effective Work</b></h3>
<p>But for the obvious essentials like a well-function computer or a laptop and great Internet connection, one should think through all the possible hurdles on the way to a smooth remote working process. Ensure that you have <strong>a backup to the cloud in case there is any accidental deletion of valuable files. </strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, your workers need to have “<a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/secure-collaboration-remote-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">access</a> to servers, development environments, and shared code.” Otherwise, your software developers teams will just stumble upon inconveniences that could lower their productivity.</p>
<h3><b>3. Think Through Communication Channels</b></h3>
<p>Even though many people hate these real face-to-face meetings, during such gatherings, you can communicate fast, transmit your ideas fast, and, most importantly, solve the existing problems fast. When working with remote developers, it is vital to have <strong>regular video meetings.</strong> Not only will regular conferences reduce the problem with the lack of information, but they also help to unite workers and show they are all in this together.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19388 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-scaled.jpg" alt="Think Through Communication Channels During Coronavirus Crisis" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<h3><b>4. Help Your Workers With Self-Organization</b></h3>
<p>If you want your developers’ team to be productive, you need to show them the importance of <strong>self-organization and discipline</strong>. Teach them to stay online during the working day. What is more, be a great example and don’t bother them with work issues at weekends and when the working day has ended.</p>
<p>Explain that the remote work schedule is no different from work in the office, and this is actually the good news. The reason is simple: you work the same amount of time, but you don’t waste your time commuting, for instance. What is more, psychologically it is less stressful when you do your job within the agreed time period, having no put offs, and then just relax after the work is done.</p>
<h3><b>5. Set Software Development Team Roles and Responsibilities</b></h3>
<p>Make sure both formal and informal roles are distributed effectively so that each employee knows exactly what their responsibilities are. When working remotely, a team <strong>“can truly benefit from having informal roles like various kinds of leaders, idea generators, critics, and doers”</strong>, as it is the key to self-management.</p>
<p>Plus, it is worth mentioning that to maximize productivity, you’d better build small teams of <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/how-manage-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-8 people</a>. Such teams are more autonomous, take responsibility for their initiatives, and as a result, are more efficient. In case you’re developing a big project, you can always divide one team into sub-teams.</p>
<h3><b>6. Keep Everyone Updated</b></h3>
<p>When working together on one project, it is crucial that <strong>all the members are in the loop</strong>, especially in the case of remote developers. For this reason, once again, think through regular conference meetings to discuss the relevant issues. Knowing the status of other projects, or being aware of any changes in the company’s goals and objectives is all crucial to an employee working remotely. That is why ensure that nobody is missing out on anything.</p>
<h3><b>7. Encourage Open Conversation </b></h3>
<p>Let us face reality, COVID-19 is not the usual flu, and it has been a long time since the last serious pandemic. That is why all the people are feeling stressed, anxious, and some can even get depressed. An employer or HR manager encourages open conversation with your workers. Make sure you ask your workers how they feel.</p>
<p><strong>“It is <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/7-tips-for-working-fsuccessfully-managing-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">believed</a> that the main struggle remote workers face is the feeling of loneliness and isolation”.</strong> For this reason, it would be a great idea to offer an opportunity for an online session with the psychologist. After all, you are working with people, and their emotional and physical being is the main priority.</p>
<h3><b>8. Remind About Data Protection</b></h3>
<p>Ensure that your employees are informed about protecting data. Remind them that it isn’t advisable to transfer work data, materials, and emails to their personal devices without permission. In case they do not have any other choice but to work on their personal laptop or computer, make sure that they <strong>take all the necessary precautions</strong> like antivirus software or not letting the browsers save some work passwords, for instance.</p>
<p>What is more, you should ensure <a href="https://intersog.com/blog/software-teams/how-to-keep-your-remote-software-development-team-safe-and-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secure connections</a> with VPN, as well as adopt smart and secure cloud storage solutions.</p>

<h3><b>9. Trust Your Developers Team</b></h3>
<p>If you want to create a comfortable and efficient working environment, it is not about tracking and monitoring productivity all the time or comparing the performance. <strong>It is about believing in your team</strong>, talking to them, and taking an interest in what bothers them. After all, it does not matter whether you work from home or stay in the office. If a team achieves the required outcome, it means they are doing a great job.</p>
<h3><b>10. Goals Are the Priority, Not Activity</b></h3>
<p>According to Forbes contributor Donal Hatter, who specializes in sales and effective leadership, <strong>it is crucial to focus on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/05/30/top-15-tips-to-effectively-manage-remote-employees/#62a35f47503c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">objectives</a> when working with a remote team.</strong> He believes that productivity boils down to the results having been achieved, rather than what is being done. For this reason, the last tip is to focus on the goals you want to achieve with your team and work towards them no matter the obstacles.</p>
<h1><b>How to Motivate and Manage Remote Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis </b></h1>
<p>Believe it or not, humanity has always been facing this or that crisis. However, the main advantage of the human race is the ability to adapt to any kind of change or environment. That is why getting used to working remotely is also just a matter of time and, in fact, is the future of work.</p>
<p>Embrace such an opportunity to build strong functionality even when your employees are not under control in the office. Be there for them, be consistent, and set clear goals. Use all the abundance of online tools to do work as productive as offline, or even better as <a href="https://www.inc.com/stephen-denny/3-ways-to-inspire-innovation-from-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working remotely</a> today may be the key to innovation tomorrow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this rapidly changing global business and humanity environment — where cost is a true strategic differentiator — Intellectsoft findings provide an inside look at the practices and trends currently shaping the future of enterprises.</p>
<p><b>In brief:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</li>
<li>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results,&#8221; — Gartner.</li>
<li>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses, including collaborative models, dedicated teams, and remote work.</li>
</ol>
<h1>1. A challenging landscape</h1>
<p>As a typical “black swan” event, COVID-19 took the world by complete surprise. This newly identified coronavirus was first seen in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, on December 31, 2019. As we almost enter April 2020, the virus has infected over 700,000 people, led to more than 30,000 deaths, and has spread to more than 200 countries.</p>
<p>The focus of most businesses is now on protecting employees, understanding the risks to their business, and managing the supply chain disruptions caused by the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. The full impact of this epidemic on businesses is still unknown. However, one thing is certain:</p>
<blockquote><p>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</p></blockquote>
<p>Optimizing costs is a perennial, continuous cross-enterprise effort organizations take into consideration now more than ever. <a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/sales-service/documents/trends/driving-cost-optimization-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost optimization</a> is a critical imperative for any functional leader, but its execution and impact reach far beyond the limits of any single functional area.</p>
<p><b>Cost optimization should not be confused with budget reductions. </b>When undertaking budget reductions, functional leaders — be they marketing leads, supply chain managers, business unit directors or technology team leaders — are often asked only to hit budget reduction targets within their own departments. While a more holistic, enterprise wide approach may be beneficial, the ability of functional leaders to impact areas outside their control is often limited.</p>
<p>Organizations should approach cost optimization as an expansive effort that can have both immediate and long-term significance for business performance. To truly serve the enterprise, cost optimization demands a mix of improvements that touch every part of the enterprise.</p>
<h1>2. Under-digitized businesses are hard-hit</h1>
<p>Businesses that are currently struggling for profitability — those with low or unstable cash reserves — are particularly vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/infrastructure-operations-cloud-germany/featured-topics/cost-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner Predicts</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, even businesses that appear to be in good financial shape may not be immune, depending on how the situation progresses. Sectors such as tourism, hospitality, entertainment and air transportation have been particularly hard-hit in the short term.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19345 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg" alt="industries that suffer the most" width="1235" height="596" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-300x145.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1024x494.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-768x371.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-600x290.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-450x217.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1000x483.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>Businesses in consumer goods and retail may also be at higher- than-normal financial risk, especially those in seasonal businesses where demand may be lost (as opposed to shifted), such as such perishable consumer goods and seasonal apparel. Even commodity-oriented industries, such as metals and mining or oil and gas, are exposed as global demand shifts and pricing fluctuates.</p>
<h1>3. Building blocks for change: cost optimization initiatives</h1>
<p>Given the importance of managing cash flows in times like this, companies should immediately develop a <b>plan for cost optimization as part of their overall business risk and </b><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/business-continuity-efforts-in-response-to-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>continuity plans</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<p>In doing so, it is essential to take a full ecosystem perspective, as the approaches you take to manage cash will have implications for not only your business but also for your customers.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19351 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization.jpg" alt="IT cost optimization pic" width="1235" height="887" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-300x215.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1024x735.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-768x552.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-600x431.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-450x323.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Key-Initiative-Overview-for-IT-Cost-Optimization-1000x718.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>Borrowing from the lessons learned from the SARS outbreak in 2003, the 2008 recession and credit crunch, and the last black swan event to significantly impact global economy — the Japanese earthquake of 2011 — we see the following practices and strategies as worth considering today.</p>
<p>Among them: ensuring your own financing remains viable, focusing on the cash-to-cash conversion cycle, thinking like a CFO, revisiting your variable costs and capital investment plans, extending payables, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Shared services, business process outsourcing, </b><a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/eventassets/en/conferences/dci9/documents/gartner-infrastructure-operations-cloud-india-cost-optimization-roadmap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>automation of IT operations</b></a> — all these components offer considerable cost saving opportunities. Enterprise cost optimization priorities — to preserve revenue, continue to innovate and keep the best staff — often conflict with the cost reduction priorities of functional leaders, which are to reduce costs quickly with as little disruption as possible.</p>
<h1>4. Five areas of focus for the enterprise</h1>
<p>While there is a great amount of functional variability in how leaders approach cost optimization, five areas of focus allow leaders in various roles and business units to pursue beneficial optimization (see the figure mentioned below).</p>
<h2>1) Benchmark to get a baseline</h2>
<p>The use of comparative metrics is a key aspect of any effective cost optimization campaign. <b>Benchmarks help leaders analyze their environments to discover what resources and initiatives may require additional funding or optimization.</b></p>
<p>Benchmarks also showcase areas of strategic investment. But care is required, as benchmarks can easily be misused.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19347 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg" alt="cost optimization across enterprise" width="1235" height="957" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1024x793.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-768x595.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-600x465.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-450x349.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1000x775.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<h2>2) Identify critical points in the budget to shield</h2>
<p>To bring more clarity to the optimization decision-making process, companies should identify:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">the potential financial benefit;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business impact;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business risk;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">time requirement of candidate cost optimization projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of impact, the effectiveness of the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Images/infographics/services/gx-deloitte-global-cost-management-infographic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost optimization initiative</a> is partly contingent on whether business unit leaders and their staff are capable of changing and adapting to new approaches and processes.</p>
<p>For example, optimization may involve frontline systems and tool automation as part of their business processes. What does this adaptation mean when leaders consider implementation and training timeframes?</p>
<p>To gain CEO or CFO approval for an initiative, leaders can describe a business case showing how the <b>cost optimization initiative will improve such criteria as:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Business processes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Time-to-market.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The like, as opposed to continuing with the status quo.</li>
</ol>
<p>These criteria points offer a suitable framework for prioritizing which line items are worth preserving, and which projects are worth supporting.</p>
<h2>3) Identify noncritical points to eliminate</h2>
<p>Just as crucial to the decision-making process is the identification of aspects of the business that can be eliminated or reduced. These changes will be primarily quantifiable as reductions in expense, but, again, leaders should consider the significance of each point to the business. An enterprise&#8217;s position within the growth model — growing, mature or declining — serves as an initial driver for identifying and prioritizing cost optimization opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Growing companies have a higher tendency to <b>standardize and simplify IT- enabled capabilities in order to optimize costs</b> and meet business goals for matching service levels to customer demand.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Mature enterprises typically respond to cost optimization goals with investment-based programs. </b>These programs aim to automate or utilize capabilities at lower capacity costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4) Determine cost optimization approach</h2>
<p>Several options exist for optimization, including reduction of costs, reduction of demand, and a balance of short- and long-term initiatives.</p>
<p>Some categories of optimization functions include:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Instituting emergency cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Applying selective cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Preserving costs and business value.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing costs for added business value.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5) Communicate plans to stakeholders and lead the organization through the change</h2>
<p>The leader of a cost optimization program will be in constant contact with all business areas. Communication of best practices should always include details of the practice and expected outcomes.</p>
<p>Leaders can also offer a list of alternative options that were considered, along with detailed explanations outlining why the alternative options were not selected.</p>
<h1>5. Accelerating through cost-efficient remote work</h1>
<p>A virtual remote workforce enables organizations to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce costs.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Drive growth and better serve customers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increase business productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Attract top talent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only remote work enables organizations to shift labor costs to lower cost resources, cut travel and expense budgets, and reduce fixed facility costs, but also a virtual workforce gives organizations a greater degree of flexibility to take advantage of lower cost labor regardless of location — and engage workers only when and where the business needs. For example, many workers sourced from outlying areas and offshore locations, such as Eastern Europe have significantly lower wages than similarly qualified resources.</p>
<p>From Google to Ford, companies around the globe are telling staff to work from home in a bid to stem the spread of pandemic. Such remote working at scale is unprecedented and will leave a lasting impression on the way people live and work for many years to come. What companies need in uncertain times is a collaborative mindset and the ability to map and analyze the value created deep within employee networks.</p>
<h1>6. Collaborative models and dedicated teams value</h1>
<p>Although collaboration is one of the most crucial components of modern businesses, most companies still do not know how to get the most out of it. Here are some of the <b>collaborative models tactics we apply here, at Intellectsoft:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The team members from different time zones are not assigned for one micro task.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Stories are organized between each other to ensure “rolling style” execution.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">All developers work shifted hours to ensure the best possible communications.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Work time designed so that all teams have 2 hours of overlap with regular PST work time.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Overlaps are used for daily scrums, any meetings and informal collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19346" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg" alt="distributed teams" width="1235" height="833" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg 1235w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-300x202.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-768x518.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-600x405.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-450x304.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1000x674.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>What companies need in a collaborative age is the ability to map and analyze the value created within employee networks. These networks should focus on both — individual and organizational effectiveness and on the value the interactions between employees and companies are created.</p>
<p>To make these interactions more useful, executives must reorient them toward the revenue and productivity benefits that collaborative models generate, the costs such interactions impose, and opportunities to improve connectivity at the points that create the greatest economic value.</p>
<h3>Dedicated Teams As More Cost-Effective Approach for Under-Digitized Businesses</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/dedicated-development-team-reimagined-and-improved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedicated team model</a> aims to provide a client with the right developers regardless of wherever the developers and the client are, and negotiate a mode of cooperation: nearshore (in close proximity to the client), onshore (on the client’s premises), or offshore (remotely).</p>
<p>Moreover, dedicated teams are known for their flexibility, niche skills, high scaling velocity, and high loyalty. As dedicated teams offer immense flexibility, the client has a lot of space to be efficient with their budget. The key industries that look for dedicated team approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthcare</a> (among them a lot of pharmaceutical companies);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/hospitality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel &amp; hospitality</a>;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/platforms/ar-construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19352 alignnone" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123.png" alt="dedicated teams" width="1033" height="462" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123.png 1033w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-300x134.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-1024x458.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-768x343.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-600x268.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-450x201.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-1000x447.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1033px) 100vw, 1033px" /></p>
<h1>7. Beyond pandemic: risks and security</h1>
<p>For some organizations, survival is the only way of implementing things today. Others are crawling through the fog of uncertainty, guessing what’s next, where should be the next turn, when things get back to normal. The question is, what will new normal look like?</p>
<p>No one can answer this question for sure now. But what we believe we can state is that the new normal is already here. The pandemic has made it harder for companies to maintain risks and so — the security and stability of their operations and even survival mode. But new tactics can help leaders to safeguard their people and organizations.</p>
<p>We, at Intellectsoft, empower companies and their workforces with digital transformation services and approaches to help them survive during these times. Are you and your organization looking for it?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The novel 2020 pandemic takes every sphere of human activity into the next level. Financial institutions are forced to move quickly to protect their employees, transform their operations, and serve customers in new, improved ways.</p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol>
<li>The software revolution — which has already disrupted many industries and has made some industries essentially obsolete — is still rapidly transforming the financial services industry.</li>
<li>Digital transformation banking strategy should include relevant technologies that can bring the most value for both the bank and its customers.</li>
<li>The future of digital banking transformation is impressive, and it is predicted to entirely change the image of traditional banks, as well as bring more services to the customers.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19371" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png" alt="The Future Of Digital Transformation in Banking" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-300x118.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-600x236.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, more and more organizations will miss their financial targets because of strategic and operational disruptions and dampened customer demand. It’s also unclear how long COVID-19 will last. But one sure thing is here — this will not be a short-term event with fewer consequences. Industries, such as banking, should prepare for the long haul.</p>
<p>However, the software revolution — which has already disrupted many industries and has made some industries essentially obsolete — is still rapidly transforming the financial services industry. Digital transformation in banking has already started, and now we can see some changes like 24/7 online banking and instant transactions.</p>
<p>Still, the process in this sphere is quite slow. To begin a journey to digital transformation, institutions have to develop a detailed strategy to change their distribution model, revise and enhance value offers, as well as develop end-to-end customer-centered processes that can result in growth and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>There are a number of technologies available nowadays that can help in the process of the digital transformation of the banking field. Good digital transformation banking strategy should include relevant technologies that can bring the most value for both the bank and its customers. Among the trending technology solutions, we can distinguish:</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>AI in banking is represented by chatbots or online assistants that help customers with their issues by providing necessary information or executing different transactions. Apart from this, AI can be used for the purpose of data analysis and security. For instance, identify money laundering by analyzing customer data within several seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchain</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of blockchain in banking can result in a better interface, more accuracy, and secured data and transactions. In addition, blockchain solutions will make transactions and different operations transparent, facilitating collaboration. There will be no need for the intermediation of the third parties, thus bringing up the level of trust from the customers. It can also influence cloud technologies and move to decentralized ones, which will result in higher protection of the data and funds.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Of Things</strong></p>
<p>IoT is helpful with real-time data analysis, thus makes the customer experience more personal, and banks are able to provide individually-tailored offers. What is more, thanks to wearables, customers can easily and seamlessly make contactless payments. Apart from this, IoT is helpful with risk management and access to platforms; the authentication process can be supported by biometric sensors that make access more secure and protected.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></p>
<p>Cloud computing is another technology that can help banks become more efficient and gives them a chance to provide more innovations, as well as have better productivity, improve operations, and instantaneously deliver products and services. Cloud computing, as well as IoT, can help with risk management and create a secure environment for the customers and internal bank systems.</p>
<p>All in all, the digital transformation of the banking field will bring great innovations that will change the image of banks we know nowadays. Technologies bring numerous opportunities both for banks and their customers by securing personal data, increasing transparency, and giving a chance to manage funds anytime and anywhere.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation In Investment Banking</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19372" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking.png" alt="Digital Transformation in Investment Banking" width="660" height="310" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-300x141.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-600x282.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-450x211.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Despite all the benefits brought by digital transformation in banking, investment banking is going to face some challenges in the current environment. Investment banking doesn’t take deposits and functions as a facilitator between buyers and sellers and keeps data protected.</p>
<p>As we have already discussed, the rise of digital solutions in banking can result in increased data transparency, elimination of intermediates in the process, and alternative methods to access financial and intellectual data. All this can result in lower pricing on the operations and make transactions easier and faster. Investment banks can be replaced by a group of small investors brought together at one digital platform. The occurrence of new players in the niche (for instance, fintech companies), eliminating entry barriers, and disintermediation can put investment banks in dire straits.</p>
<p>Still, it’s not all doomed, as there always will be a need for professional advice on complex operations and big deals. In order to survive in this competing world, the investment banks should think of the ways to use available data and skills in the digitalized world.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation In Retail Banking</h2>
<p>Retail banks have more opportunities in comparison with investment banks, but still, the journey to digital transformation is rather long and requires a lot of resources. First of all, in order to succeed, their strategy should be customer-centered. Banks possess a lot of important data that can be used as a background for new innovative solutions and services that can satisfy customers to the full.</p>
<p>Technologies like blockchain and AI (Artificial Intelligence) can be of great advantage if the bank wants to survive competition with fintech companies, online banks, and non-financial platforms that provide exact services to their customers and have more advantages over traditional banks. These tools can automate numerous manual operations, thus enhance customer satisfaction. Also, AI and IoT can be used together to collect and analyze personal data of the customers for the banks to create more personalized offers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19373" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking.png" alt="Digital Transformation in Retail Banking" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-300x118.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-600x236.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for retail banks in this situation can be to find a professional team or create an inner IT department. But thanks to the available platforms and outsource companies, this issue can be easily overcome.</p>
<h2>Advantages And Disadvantages Of Digital Transformation In Banking</h2>
<p>Digital transformation of the banking institutions brings a lot of new opportunities for the customers, individual ones, small companies, and huge corporations, as well as banks themselves. Clever strategy and constant improvements can result in a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convenience<br />
</strong>Personal and company bank accounts are available at any device, the only things you need are an Internet connection and a few taps on the screen. This brings more customer satisfaction as they are able to constantly keep on track of their account balance and manage the information on their personal profile (add new mailing address, e-mails, telephone numbers, etc.). In addition to this, there is no need to go to the bank to get checks as they can be instantly sent to your email address.</li>
<li><strong>24/7 Service<br />
</strong>Online banking services are available 24/7 all year round, even at the weekends. There is no need to stay in lines and wait for the bank to open in order to conduct certain operations. It’s a huge advantage that comes with digital solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Time-Saving<br />
</strong>Another advantage, you save a lot of time as you have access to the account from home. It is extremely convenient as previously you could waste an hour or two at the bank to make simple operations, and now it is done seamlessly from home or any other place where there is an Internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Transfers<br />
</strong>Direct banks can provide unlimited automated transfers (accept payroll deposits or provide automatic bill payment) with no additional fees for the services even to outside financial institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Management<br />
</strong>Online accounts can be easily managed, although they require more information than traditional banks. Customers can add information themselves or directly contact online assistants to provide support on the current issue. What is more, payee information is retained within the system, there is no need to re-enter data for the following payments, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19374" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png" alt="Advantages and Disadvantages of Digital Transformation in Banking" width="660" height="340" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-300x155.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-600x309.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-450x232.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Although the advantages are impressive, and they facilitate the work to a great extent, there are still some disadvantages that follow the process. Here are the main ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Issues<br />
</strong>Cybersecurity is one of the most important issues that companies and institutions are struggling to overcome. Even sophisticated software that protects tentative data cannot completely protect accounts from scammers, phishing, hacker attacks, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Services<br />
</strong>Nowadays, not all banks can offer a wide range of online services. Still, there are some that require your presence at the traditional banks.</li>
<li><strong>Transactions<br />
</strong>Complex transactions may also require the presence at the bank office. Also, international transactions are not possible with all digital banks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of disadvantages is rather low, and it’s only a matter of time for them to disappear. Advantages take over disadvantages and make daily operations much easier, reduce costs, save customer’s time, and manage to provide services efficiently.</p>
<h2>Challenges Of Digital Transformation In Banking</h2>
<p>The future of digital banking transformation is impressive, and it is predicted to entirely change the image of traditional banks, as well as bring more services to the customers. But today banks face certain challenges that are difficult to overcome:</p>
<h3>Competition With Non-Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>Amazon is trying to provide banking opportunities to its customers. Facebook allows users to make transfers directly to other people’s bank accounts, thus leaving banks out of the process. But banks are more regulated institutions, thus more secure. It is important for them to go digital quicker.</p>
<h3>Online Payments</h3>
<p>Not every bank can support online/mobile or contactless payments. The reason for this is that a bank cannot provide another option but physical payment as it doesn’t have a secure online platform, resources, and skilled team to make it possible. It gets even harder to compete with available online services like ApplePay and PayPal.</p>
<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p>The system that provides online banking services should be constantly updated and have an efficient security level. Cybersecurity is one of the most important issues nowadays that banks should take into consideration first of all. Again, in order to overcome this challenge, the bank has to set up a detailed strategy, choose appropriate technologies and find a professional team that can easily turn ideas into reality with the latest software and available tools.</p>
<p>The process of digital transformation is rather endless as technologies enhance, the systems should be constantly updated. New technologies will give a chance for new services to appear that again will require constant upgrade and support.</p>
<p>Digital transformation in banking is going to speed up in the upcoming years. Financial institutions should take into account the current state of affairs, work out a profound strategy, and use the right tools in order to succeed in the future.</p>
<p>The transformation journey is not an easy thing and involves a lot of resources, but as a result, the services could be more secured and delivered quicker, and most of all, enhance the level of customer satisfaction. As technologies develop and enhance, the banking industry will also get better and better year by year.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Over the past 20 years, advanced technologies and innovations have changed the way the hospitality industry brings value to travelers around the world. With all the opportunities, digital transformation is reshaping the industry, leaving some players behind, customers’ behavior has shifted with astonishing speed towards new, innovative experiences.</p>
<p>Digital transformation is, no doubt, one of the key drivers of industry growth today. But since the sudden COVID-19 pandemic outbreak hit the “pause button” hard-full stop, the hospitality industry especially is losing its positions day after day.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, consumers always continue to demand improved solutions and unique experiences. The industry is rapidly adopting new technologies to exceed their expectations and digitize the customer journey with one-tap check-ins, digital concierge services, voice-activated devices, chatbots, smart in-room technologies, advanced analytics, virtual-assistant platforms, enhanced direct bookings, and more to come.</p>
<h1>Travel. Transformed.</h1>
<p>Many companies from the hospitality industry are still only entering the new exciting world of digitalization. To create a more seamless guest experience, more hotels automate and streamline the travel processes, developing the advanced tools necessary to capture the full potential of data.</p>
<p>Moreover, considering that millennials are increasingly dominating the travel sector, hospitality companies should be prepared to curate and personalized travel offerings and to make a data-enabled transformation work. This generation of tech-savvy travelers prefers using apps for bookings and getting more personalized interactions.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><i>In the era of connected enterprises and total digitalization, finding a balance between optimizing productivity and innovating has never been simpler, yet more difficult, than ever before. </i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial intelligence</a>, machine learning, the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/internet-of-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet of Things</a>, automation, and <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other technologies</a> bring us more and more new types of data. On the one hand, it’s good to have a space for maneuvers. However, on the other hand, many senior executives remain less prepared than they think they are. Navigating the <strong>Fourth Industrial Revolution not only changes the way we think but also impacts how we learn and work using data</strong> to create value from the findings obtained through advanced technologies.</p>
<h2>An amalgam of opportunity and ambiguity</h2>
<p>According to a recent Deloitte Global <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/tr/Documents/manufacturing/Industry4-0_Are-you-ready_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a>, 72% of C-level executives across 19 countries (from the Americas, Asia, and Europe, and came from all major industry sectors) are <strong>ready to adopt and effectively use smart and autonomous technologies</strong> within their organizations.</p>
<p>43% of them consider a lack of internal alignment about which strategies to follow, as the most significant challenge their organizations face as they seek to adopt new technologies and applications. Intellectsoft’s experts have created unique infographics to shed some light on the most vital aspects and challenges the concept of Industry 4.0 owns today.</p>

<h2>What’s next? A New Lens of Innovation or Another Revolution</h2>
<p>When it comes to an impact Industry 4.0 will have on organizations and, most importantly, on the workforce, many questions arise. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/tr/Documents/manufacturing/Industry4-0_Are-you-ready_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22% of executives</a> surveyed believe that the new industrial revolution will have a significant effect on their companies. Another question — what kind of effect it will be.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Industry 4.0 is bringing changes to every geography and solution. Yet many executives still do not express the urgency of tackling the challenge of using the full potential of smart technologies to enable digital-physical integration. It is evident that the old way of doing things isn’t enough anymore, but many executives continue to focus on traditional business operations.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The digital transformation itself is a trend of the past years and it’s only starting to kick into high gear. Due to the fast development of technologies, it was inevitable for the companies to acquire them and implement to enhance their services. The number of available technologies and tools adds up to the process. Thus, step by step companies are moving towards digital transformation.</p>
<p>Integration of digital technologies into work of different companies, small ones and big enterprises, as well as its usage in mass media, government systems, culture, health industry, etc., opens up a lot of opportunities. It also facilitates workflow, company organization and gives a chance to deliver high-quality services to customers faster. So, what are the most popular digital transformation trends? Let’s discuss them in detail.</p>
<h2>What are They 10 Top Digital Transformation Trends in 2020?</h2>
<p>Some of the trends in digital transformation have already been widely used but keep to be core ones. Providing research on the ones that will prevail in 2020, we have come up with the list.</p>
<ol>
<li>XaaS: Everything-As-A-ServiceProviding services via cloud and the Internet is one of the growing trends in digital transformation. SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) and PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) are already used and successfully deployed for various business purposes. The number of services delivered in this way is growing and expanding, creating a big set of tools that make up into XaaS. For instance, Hardware-as-a-Service (HaaS), Communication-as-a-Service (CaaS), Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS), Security-as-a-Service (SECaaS), Healthcare-as-a-Service (HaaS), Transport-as-a-Service (TaaS), etc. Everyone is familiar with the last one, as we all have already tried it. It’s Uber and Uber-like services where you can easily find a car, as well as share it with someone else, via the Internet.XaaS has a lot of benefits both for business and customers that include absolute scalability of the processes (level up or down when necessary and in accordance with the needs of an enterprise), cost- and time-effectiveness (there is no need to install equipment as XaaS uses pay-and-go scheme), impeccable services (all the tools are constantly updated). What is more, previously mentioned advantages lead to one of the most important one &#8211; customer satisfaction and loyalty.</li>
<li>CloudThe rise of XaaS leads to further development of Cloud computing. It’s important for the enterprises to adopt cloud as it is essential for digital transformation. Cloud computing enables scalability, flexibility, operational agility, data decoding, a gathering of consumer insights, task management, etc. The technology gives a chance to develop, test, and deploy apps without building complex infrastructures. Also, it facilitates communication and collaboration of the company’s teams by giving access to the information from any place and any time that results in more efficient services.</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)AI and ML are one of the digital transformation trends that are not going to stop growing and penetrating into a bigger number of fields. As technology enhances, AI will be of great help not only to businesses but also to government, health industry, manufacture, etc. In addition to this, it will be useful for marketing strategies and business plans. AI can enhance production phase thanks to its analytical skills, as a quick and efficient revision of the processes will show where you can save some time.AI technologies soon will be irreplaceable in the healthcare industry. For instance, we want to make treatment more personalized and that will have better results for the patient. AI tools can examine and analyze different cases of the same disease, including body measurements, disease history, medications used, etc., to come up with the best treatment for a particular patient. It’s going to revolutionize the healthcare industry, as people won’t waste their time on the wrong treatment and there will be a chance to cure diseases quicker and more effectively.</li>
<li>Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)<img class="aligncenter wp-image-18751 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-Trends-Augmented-Reality-AR-and-Virtual-Reality-VR.jpg" alt="Digital Transformation Trends Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)" width="452" height="301" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-Trends-Augmented-Reality-AR-and-Virtual-Reality-VR.jpg 452w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-Trends-Augmented-Reality-AR-and-Virtual-Reality-VR-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-Trends-Augmented-Reality-AR-and-Virtual-Reality-VR-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" />Augmented reality is something in between real and virtual ones. It has been already implemented by several companies and shows excellent results. For example, IKEA has created a mobile application that allows its users to find the most suitable furniture without even going to the shop. You can direct a camera to the place where you want to see a new piece of furniture and the app will show you the best options, even give some advice.Another helpful use of AR tools will be for the examination of different things, for instance, cars. If the car is broken, AR can analyze it and show where it should be fixed without even looking into it or knocking down.VR will also expand in the nearest future and will be used widely in education, construction, tourism, etc. Just imagine, students can practise their skills and apply knowledge without leaving a classroom that will give them hands-on experience and prepare to dill with all sorts of tasks effectively.</li>
<li>Big Data Analysis<img class="aligncenter wp-image-18752 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-Trends-Big-Data-Analysis-.jpg" alt="Digital Transformation Trends Big Data Analysis" width="452" height="301" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-Trends-Big-Data-Analysis-.jpg 452w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-Trends-Big-Data-Analysis--300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-Trends-Big-Data-Analysis--450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" />By taking into consideration previous points of the list, it is inevitable for big data analysis to develop and be one of the major trends. Development of high-quality analytical tools is essential for digital transformation. Every field will need special equipment and technologies that can easily and effectively analyze the received data. Companies should invest in this sphere as user data has a lot of advantages for them that might result in higher revenue and a bigger number of clients.</li>
<li>5G5G is the most expected trend in 2020. Big telecommunication providers are already working on 5G deployment and it will definitely hit the world this year. Although it is usually associated with smartphones, 5G value is not limited by them. It will accelerate the advancement of smart manufacturing, smart vehicles, and cities. In other words, the advantages are limitless and it can revolutionize different fields, including education, healthcare, agriculture, and business. What is more, in combination with AR and IoT, it can bring even more opportunities. 5G enables companies to accelerate their digital transformation process by transmitting huge quantities of data faster, and with the help of AI, the data can be analyzed quicker and more effectively.</li>
<li>BlockchainIt is forespoken that blockchain will be associated not only with cryptocurrency. The technology has great potential and is able to reshape different industries, including eCommerce, banking, retails, etc. Among the benefits of blockchain, we can distinguish value exchange and transparency, it can result in cost transaction reduction, settlement times, and improve cash flow. By now, banking is the most manure field of blockchain implementation but it will expand to other fields of human activity.</li>
<li>IoTInternet of Things will also continue to develop and interconnect more and more devices. Huge volumes of information that will be transferred across numerous networks need better protection. It results in enhancement of IoT security field. It is essential as people should be protected from scammers and malicious attacks. Apart from this, retail is where IoT can add up to the user experience by simplifying online shopping.Moving even further, IoT supported features will help with energy and resource management, for instance, indoor temperature control.</li>
<li>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)The adoption of RPA by different businesses will also grow in 2020. RPA is the automation of frequently repeated tasks by robots. The aim is to save time on showing how something works. It gives employees more freedom as RPA demonstrates the processes and completes tasks accurately.RPA is more likely to be used as a complementary technology to the AI or IoT, but it can add up to the development of Smart Cities and automated cars.</li>
<li>Driverless Cars, Smart Cities and DronesThe use of above-mentioned technologies and solutions for digital transformation soon can result in smart cities, driverless vehicles, and automated drones. All digital technologies add up to the process by improving the infrastructure of the cities, emergy usage, housing, security, mobility, etc. Thanks to easy and quick connectivity, data analytics and its processing, the information can be gathered and evaluated, creating an image of “city behaviour”. Access to real-time data from various devices facilitates the life of citizens. For instance, by using digital technologies, governments and city authorities can involve people to participate in city life to a greater extent. What is more, big data analysis can provide solutions for more efficient ways of energy consumption, etc.Car manufacturers are already working on the development of automated cars that can serve around the city. Drone automation is also an essential part of smart cities as they can enhance security and keep a peaceful environment. Digital era is fast approaching and soon we might experience the fourth industrial revolution.</li>
</ol>
<p>As can be seen, there is a number of technologies that can help all kinds of businesses (small, middle, and enterprises) to grow, develop, and deliver high-quality services to the customers. Take into consideration the advantages these tools and technologies bring and make the best use of them for your own purposes. Going digital is a long-term project but the results you might get worth heading in this direction. Still, in order to survive in this highly-competitive world, you have to adjust to changes quickly and keep your fingers on the pulse of digital transformation trends.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to business, small companies and huge enterprises should quickly react to the latest changes in their field, technologies, marketing strategies, etc. They should be able to adapt to current trends and successfully implement them into the workflow of their system.</p>
<p>The faster and wisely you respond to the changes, the more chances you get to succeed in the future. Marketing and business overall are not static, and it is essential to keep up with trends, use them for your company, thus gaining more customers and revenue. Nowadays, businesses go through digital transformation. What is it? How can it benefit your business?</p>
<p>Let’s dive into the details of this topic.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Definition Explained</h2>
<p>Digital transformation is an integration of digital technology solutions into the work of the company. Although the term is mainly used about business, it is also applied to government, mass media, culture, medicine, science segments of society. It changes the way the company works and elevates the customer experience. Digital transformation is also used as a synonym to “paperless,” meaning that all the data is digitalized and stored in the company’s system.</p>
<p>The implementation of these solutions into your business will affect every department and all the operations that are carried within the company. It will change the way your company functions internally and externally. Thus, going through digital transformation successfully will bring value to the overall business workflow and customer experience.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Examples: You’ve Already Seen Them</h2>
<p>If you think that you haven’t seen any digital transformation examples, you are wrong. The change might be slow, but it happens. For instance, have you shopped on Nike’s website? You can check it if you didn’t. The first thing that impresses most is that you can create your own design of the shoes online. Thus, the user experience becomes more personalized, and the company can offer the best options available to suit the customer&#8217;s taste. What is more, there is no vendor involved in the process, and customers buy the products directly from Nike.</p>
<p>Another bright example of digital transformation is Disney. A few years ago, they were falling behind, but the company has come up with the idea of buying streaming services and turning Disney into the online platform, where you can watch movies. As a result, they are back on track and managed to increase their revenue.</p>
<p>One more example is Microsoft who has shifted from traditional software to cloud-based and managed to survive the competition with Apple and Amazon.</p>
<p>The examples of digital transformation can be found everywhere nowadays affecting every area of human activity.</p>
<h2>What’s the Difference Between Digital Transformation and Business Transformation?</h2>
<p>When it comes to business and digital transformations, the first one is a broader term that incorporates other transformations. It means that when a company wants to keep up with the latest tendencies that are appearing daily and wishes to deliver better services, have a better workflow, and better communication with customers, it has to go through a business transformation.</p>
<p>So, a business transformation involves all the changes in every department of the company and consists of:<br />
&#8211; digital transformation (mainly is directed to facilitate and enhance the customer area of the company or inner company organization);<br />
&#8211; IT functional transformation (focuses on how the work is done within the IT department of the company);<br />
&#8211; enterprise transformation (directed on how the work is done within the company).</p>
<p>To put it in other words, a business transformation requires to set new business models that much depend on modern market demands. While digital transformation is about how this model can work and what tools and solutions are necessary to make new strategies work in the best way possible, meaning facilitating business-customer area of work, business-business cooperation, as well as inner company system organization of work (business-employee). Digital transformation is focused on technological tools and solutions that can deal with operational problems to reach the goal of business transformation.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Framework: The Guidelines</h2>
<p>To successfully implement and use new technologies, you have to come up with the guidelines. In other words, you need a blueprint, which is a digital transformation framework, with a detailed description of the process, parties, and components involved. It is a supporting structure around which you can build-in new technologies, and you can flawlessly move from one thing to another according to it along the way to digitalization.</p>
<p>Digital transformation framework involves four components:<br />
&#8211; Processes and systems;<br />
&#8211; Organization;<br />
&#8211; Product;<br />
&#8211; Customer.</p>
<p>It is important to note that no specific framework will work for all the existing businesses, but there are essential components that should be taken into consideration. Thus, the CEO of the companies can analyze the data they have and create an individualized framework for their business. For instance, customers are an essential part of every business. Learn more about your customers. See what they like or dislike by going through the information they search for. This information is vital for modern businesses as they can use this data in digital marketing and personalize services, and as a result, enhance the customer experience.</p>
<p>Apart from better customer experience, the information you get from them can be used to enhance the products and make them suit customers individually. The same goes for services and processes. You can provide personalized service by taking into account the data you have about the clients and lead them through the whole purchase process.</p>
<p>Apart from this, think about how you can empower the inner company organization. You can improve logistics and employee experience by using digital technologies (like cloud, IoT, AI, etc.). By choosing automation and standardization, businesses can stay agile and quickly respond and adjust to the latest changes, as well as maintain and increase the profit.</p>
<p>To create a successful framework of digital transformation define all the important aspects of your company that stand behind these four components.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Roadmap</h2>
<p>The moment you set a framework of digital transformation, you can start building a roadmap of the process. To make it easier, remember that there are three main stages that should be outlined and divided into smaller steps in the roadmap. Here they are:</p>
<p>Stage 1: Defining value. This stage involves securing senior management. It’s the first step. You have to make sure that everyone in the company is involved in the process and takes an active part in it. Gather board meetings with management, as well as different departments of the company, to define the goals of the transformation. Make them challenging and motivating. The last but not least step on this stage is the budget. Allocate funds on the resources and technologies to be used.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Launching and maintaining a digital transformation. First, think of the lighthouse projects you can launch at the beginning of the transformation process. Once they are tested and operate at their best, you can follow up with the related projects to continue the transformation. Next, gather high-profile professionals in your team who will have all the necessary skills. Moving further, think of the new agile ways of the work organization.</p>
<p>Stage 3: Scaling up. From now on you have to continually upgrade and innovate the technologies you use as they develop and continuously offer new features and capabilities. Apart from technology, your employees should also be appropriately trained and be able to acquire new skills. And the last thing that should be included in the roadmap is the adoption of the new operating model. From now on, the focus will be shifted to new centers, so the model should suit them.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Technology: What Can Be Used?</h2>
<p>Digital transformation for businesses of different industries is necessary due to all the emerging technologies. These technologies change the way companies function and organize their work. They help to deliver better user experience, as well as bring more revenue for the business.</p>
<p>Today we have several technologies that can be implemented into the company’s system. Each technology can be tailored to the needs of your business and level up the services you provide. There are certain tendencies in the technology used for the digital transformation of the enterprise, this list includes:</p>
<p>&#8211; Cloud Computing<br />
Cloud computing can be the first thing to consider when embarking on the path of digital transformation. There are several good reasons for this. Think about how you can improve internal and external processes, operations, and services. Cloud computing has the required infrastructure, platforms, and computing abilities, thus helps you stay agile in your business field and ready to embrace the latest changes in the world of technology. Taking this into account, Cloud computing is cost and labor effective, secure (you can omit system shutdowns and create several backups). Scale and speed come with Cloud computing, two essential things the company needs to move towards digital transformation nowadays.</p>
<p>&#8211; Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)<br />
AI and ML, when properly used for digital transformation, can help businesses gain additional income and reduce time spent on executing day-today activities. ML is capable of analyzing big and complex data and making accurate decisions based on the available information. Thanks to the implementation of these technologies there is less room for errors and more for impeccable high-quality service.</p>
<p>&#8211; Blockchain<br />
Blockchain is a powerful asset for the companies that are heading to digital transformation. The use of this technology will facilitate transactions, eliminating the third party in the process, thus making it easier and more transparent both for partner businesses and clients. The point is to make decentralized ledger that will reduce transaction time and cost, as well as will be more secure.</p>
<p>&#8211; Augmented Reality (AR)<br />
Augmented Reality is a technology that can change and boost operational activities of the departments and enhance the competitiveness of the company on the market. AR gives a chance to see inside of the objects (for instance, machines, bodies, etc.) without opening them and have a full description of the problem found inside. It can be applied for product development, maintenance, and safety measures.</p>
<p>&#8211; Internet of Things (IoT)<br />
Another way to make a digital transformation is to use the Internet of Things (IoT). Like the previous ones, this technology brings a lot of benefits to the business. For instance, it opens several new opportunities for the company thanks to the collected data that can be used to understand your customers and their needs better and, as a result, offering them better services. Also, IoT can help you expand the circle of your target audience. In addition, it improves employee productivity and reduces costs, as the processes are automized.</p>
<p>Think of the technologies listed above and how they can be useful for your company.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Process: How Is It Done?</h2>
<p>Digital transformation cannot be completed in one day. It’s rather a continuous process that involves a lot of work. Any process involves several stages, so you should think about the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/what-is-digital-transformation-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategy</a> for your company, the execution part of the process, and its outcome. Setting a plan is ⅓ of the process, but going digital without one is a lost cause. Here are the steps you should follow to outline the process of digital transformation:</p>
<p>Step 1. Analyze the current state of affairs within the company and outside. It is important to understand where you stand at this very moment, know your strong and weak sides. Check how the competitors are dealing with the similar problems you face.</p>
<p>Step 2. Set up transformation objectives. What do you want to see as the final result? What is the goal of the company? Which operations, departments, or processes should be renovated? These are the essential questions you have to answer before moving to the next stages of the process. Involve your employees into the process as much as possible, as they do certain activities daily and know all the pitfalls or inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Step 3. Choose the right technology and outline the budget. When thinking of the technology to be implemented into the work of the company, provide thorough research. The technology should suit the needs of your company, employees, and clients. Communicate with the vendor and set close relationships for further collaboration, as support of the system is as important as its development or implementation. Make sure the technology is scalable, so you can continue to grow if some part needs to be innovated or changed.</p>
<p>Step 4. Create a clear roadmap for the process and prioritize the activities. Access the capabilities of the company, resources, budget, identify changes, and do a cost-benefit analysis. Then, logically prioritize activities.</p>
<p>Step 5. Identify and train your team. Choose employees and create teams that can execute the implementation of technology. All the changes that are going to be made should be demonstrated to the employees. It is important to educate your staff, so can do digitally transformed business, once the system starts to operate differently.</p>
<p>Step 6. Implement the changes. Do everything that is required to incorporate the technology into the work of your company, run tests, and add additional changes if needed.</p>
<p>Step 7. Provide ongoing support of the new technologies and use new features to scale up the performance of the system and services.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Digital Transformation: How Is It Useful for Your Business?</h2>
<p>Taking into account the information stated above, we can highlight several benefits that come with digital transformation. Although the process can be time-consuming and require a lot of resources to be completed, still the advantages it offers, cover the expenses.</p>
<p>So, what are the benefits we get with the digital transformation of business?</p>
<p>1. Less manual work as operations and processes will be automized, thus making the overall work more efficient and almost flawless.<br />
2. Reduced time spent on day-to-day activities, as the system will be automized.<br />
3. The client’s satisfaction will grow. It follows from the benefits listed above. Flawless and quick service will win the hearts of your clients and more likely make them your regular customers.<br />
4. Increased revenue. This advantage is also a result of the listed above. Reduced time and errors in the process save up a lot of funds, and loyal clients will bring more revenue.</p>
<p>These are four significant benefits a digital transformation brings to businesses, both small and large ones. Of course, the list is not complete, as everyone will find something different for their own business.</p>
<h2>Future of Digital Transformation: What Is Next?</h2>
<p>Digital transformation is a rather new concept for now, and it only starts to develop and penetrate different business fields and spheres of human activity. We already know the benefits it possesses and can only imagine how it will look like in the future, as the technologies constantly upgrade, evolve, and acquire new features.</p>
<p>The tendency mainly prevails in IT and financial spheres, but it has a lot of potential and can be used to improve government matters, health, and insurance, retail, education, etc. Companies should take a serious look at digital transformation and make use of it for their systems to survive current and future competitions, keep their clients and increase revenue.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good beginning makes the good ending, so it goes without saying that choosing a system and style of management smart is the key to success when developing software. These days there are tons of approaches each having its pluses and minuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential to choose the smart strategy at the very beginning as well as defining your goals, objectives, budget and deadlines. That is why, we have investigated the issue to provide you with the ultimate guide on what methodology to use.</span></p>
<h2>History of Software Development Methodologies</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all began in 1950s and keeps on evolving, new approaches appearing until today. To put it shortly, throughout every decade, a particular methodology was supposed to best suit the needs of the time and perfect apt to solve the problems of the then days. Every new system was meant to make the development more productive and boost the desired results.</span></p>
<h2>Types of Software Development Methodologies</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what is the software development procedure all about? It has to do with dividing the working process into various stages, as well as delegating various task among different employees. What is more, it presupposes taking some specific approach to organizing and optimizing the whole development process and managing the team work. That is why, there are various types of methodologies aimed at improving SDLC. So here are the top ones we are going to examine.</span></p>
<h3>Software Development Methodologies List</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the list below we have presented 12 most common methodologies, the gist of every approach, their advantages and disadvantages.</span></p>
<h4>1. Agile Development Methodology</h4>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-17966 size-medium" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Agile-Development-Methodology-300x148.png" alt="Agile Development Methodology" width="300" height="148" /></p>
<p><strong>Gist:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The main focus of this methodology is the project/product itself. That is why, it presupposes various constant alterations based on users and customers feedback, as well as internal changes related to the work of engineers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile software development methodology </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is free of rigid frameworks on the one hand. While, on the other hand, the working process is divided into short time boxes, thus offering the real results and feedbacks truly fast.</span></p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems are fixed at the early stage, so the quality of the final product is often top-notch.</span></p>
<p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It is easy to get off track with all the constant changes and amendments aimed at improving the product.</span></p>
<h4>2. Waterfall Development Methodology</h4>
<p><b>Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The absolute opposite to the previous approach, this methodology is strict and linear. A new stage can only be started if the previous one is completed. In other words, each phase gradually flows into the next one. What is more, there is no going back to the previous stage. This approach is easy to understand as it presupposes a strict sequence of completed tasks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waterfall methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is often regarded as a classic representation of software development.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is simple, functional, gradual and analytical.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Works good with exact requirements and needs only. Weak for long or ongoing projects.</span></b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17967 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Waterfall-Development-Methodology.png" alt="Waterfall Development Methodology" width="604" height="245" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Waterfall-Development-Methodology.png 604w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Waterfall-Development-Methodology-300x122.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Waterfall-Development-Methodology-600x243.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Waterfall-Development-Methodology-450x183.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p>
<h4>3. <b>Extreme Programming</b></h4>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-17968" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-300x200.png" alt="Extreme Programming" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-300x200.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-768x512.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-600x400.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-450x300.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming-1000x667.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Extreme-Programming.png 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><b>Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect approach for unstable projects, as it implies involving the customer as much as possible. What is more, it presupposes considerable flexibility. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extreme programming methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is believed to boost the quality of software owing to its ability to adapt to dynamic changing demands. In addition to that, constant feedback and communication is the key to efficient and happy team environment.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significant customer involvement results in high quality products. Immediate feedback and courage to take difficult decisions.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiency is much dependent on the people involved. Vague and unknown future results.</span></p>
<h4><b>4. Lean Development</b></h4>
<p><b><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-17969" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-300x210.jpg" alt=" Lean Development" width="300" height="210" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-1024x718.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-1536x1077.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-600x421.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-450x315.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development-1000x701.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lean-Development.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Value for the client is the essential core element the whole approach revolves around. If something is worth, it should be done immediately; if not, it should be removed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean development methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focuses a lot on losses reduction. That is why, the whole project is examined significantly beforehand to eliminate any wasted time or money. As value is the core component, feedback plays the crucial role itself, so that the actions are taken fast.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect for low-budget project and rigid time limitations.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Success is much dependent on the working capacity of a team. Too much of a flexibility can lead to loss of a focus.</span></p>
<h4>5. Prototype Model</h4>
<p><b><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-17970" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Prototype-Model--293x300.png" alt=" Prototype Model" width="293" height="300" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Prototype-Model--293x300.png 293w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Prototype-Model--768x787.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Prototype-Model--600x615.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Prototype-Model--439x450.png 439w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Prototype-Model-.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px" />Gist:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Based on the waterfall approach and having a significant focus on customer feedback. There are some initial requirements, developers provide samples, and only after customers evaluate the functionality of samples, the final development begins. The gist of this method lies in the name itself &#8211; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prototype methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In other words, before getting down to business, there will be painstaking research and prototyping to avoid unnecessary risks.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased chances of top quality functionality and low risks of failure.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possible budget increase, as the management cost may go beyond the money limit. Too much of client involvement can affect the process by slowing it down.</span></p>
<h4>6. <b>Dynamic Systems Model</b></h4>
<p><b><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-17971" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dynamic-Systems-Model-280x300.jpg" alt="Dynamic Systems Model" width="280" height="300" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dynamic-Systems-Model-280x300.jpg 280w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dynamic-Systems-Model-600x643.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dynamic-Systems-Model-420x450.jpg 420w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Dynamic-Systems-Model.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" />Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two main focuses: strict time frame and assigned budget. The idea is to manage to provide a successful and effective software within a particular time limit and not exceeding costs. Users involvement is of high importance as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamic systems model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presupposes continuous feedback to deliver maximum functionality within the agreed requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great communication between developers and users resulting in reaching the needed functionality as fast as possible.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs are quite considerable. The approach will not fit and meet the needs of a small organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>7. <b>Feature Driven Development</b></h4>
<p><b>Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Features are regarded as sort of users feedback. Planning, designing and building is all feature-based. This approach involves iterations to boost functionality and deal with varied complexities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feature driven development </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aims at organizing the work of a large number of teams within a big organization.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great dealing with huge projects. The pre-set standards simplify the developing procedure. Enables any developer with appropriate experience and expertise handle the tasks.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannot be applied by small organization. Needs leading developers to monitor the process. Difficult to guarantee the strict deadline.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17972" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Driven-Development-.jpg" alt="Feature Driven Development" width="988" height="524" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Driven-Development-.jpg 988w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Driven-Development--300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Driven-Development--768x407.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Driven-Development--600x318.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Driven-Development--450x239.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px" /></p>
<h4>8. <b>Rational Unified Process</b></h4>
<p><b>Gist:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The idea of this approach lies in having four stages of developing process. ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During each of the phases, all six core development disciplines take place &#8211; business modelling, requirements, analysis and design, implementation, testing and deployment’, according to study.com. The main focus of this methodology is craft an effective software of high quality without expanding the budget and missing the time frame.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reliable and strict documentation. Risks avoidance taking into consideration clients evolving needs.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considerably expert developer needed. May be too difficult to make head or tail of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rational unified process model.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17973" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Rational-Unified-Process.jpg" alt="Rational Unified Process" width="740" height="387" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Rational-Unified-Process.jpg 740w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Rational-Unified-Process-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Rational-Unified-Process-600x314.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Rational-Unified-Process-450x235.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></p>
<h4>9. <b>Spiral Model</b></h4>
<p><b><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-17974" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-300x250.png" alt="Spiral Model" width="300" height="250" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-300x250.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-1024x853.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-768x640.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-600x500.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-450x375.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model-1000x833.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Spiral-Model.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main idea is to eliminate the risks at the early stage of the project. The developing procedure goes from smaller level to the big ones gradually. This approach combines waterfall ideas with iterations. Each stage involves setting the goals and receiving feedback from a client. Moving from one phase to another in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">spiral model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implies completing and removing the risks before moving forward.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Process of estimating the costs is easy. Iterations help to manage the risks. There is a system of developing procedure, thus progress is achieved fast.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danger of failing to meet the agreed budget and time limit. Not suitable for small organizations and projects.</span></p>
<h4>10. <b>Joint Application Development</b></h4>
<p><b>Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach implies significant interaction between users, designers and developers. There are workshop sessions to facilitate and increase the developing process. During the session the following people are involved: a facilitator, end users, developers, observers, mediators and experts. What is more, in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">joint application development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there is a considerable focus on eliminating errors at the early stage, thus saving the expenses needed to correct the mistakes later on.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valuable info is achieved within a short time period. Immediate elimination of errors and resolving the differences.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can be quite time and energy consuming when it comes to planning. Requires significant budget. Needs highly experienced and expert professionals.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17975" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Joint-Application-Development.jpg" alt="Joint Application Development" width="988" height="524" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Joint-Application-Development.jpg 988w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Joint-Application-Development-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Joint-Application-Development-768x407.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Joint-Application-Development-600x318.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Joint-Application-Development-450x239.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px" /></p>
<h4>11. <b>Scrum Development</b></h4>
<p><b>Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to understand and effective when it comes to achieving results. The working process is divided into sprints. All the assignments for each sprint are set beforehand and are then discussed after this time period. Thanks to this approach, it is easy to get response to emerging problems early, and as a result solve them immediately. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scrum development methodology </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is by far the most flexible. For this reason, it easily deals with projects having changing requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is responsible for decision-making. Light control goes together with constant updating that keeps all of the team always on guard.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs needed can often be uncertain. Big projects cannot be managed with this approach. Only expert professionals can be involved, with no beginners.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17976" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Development.png" alt="Scrum Development" width="606" height="312" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Development.png 606w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Development-300x154.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Development-600x309.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Scrum-Development-450x232.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px" /></p>
<h4>12. <b>Rapid Application Development</b></h4>
<p><b>Gist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clear from its name that the main goal of this approach is to achieve fast results. To do so it uses the assistance of other development methodologies. It focuses on fast prototype releases and iterations. As a result, the quick feedback is received, errors are eliminated and the desired results are reached. It is as flexible and adaptable as possible. The main focus is to adjust, so that the software is crafted functional and effective fast. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapid application development methodology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes 5 stages: analysis and quick design, prototype cycles, testing and implementation.</span></p>
<p><b>Benefits: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Client is encouraged to take fast reviews. Customers provide constant feedback for improvement.</span></p>
<p><b>Drawbacks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not suitable for small projects. Highly expert employees are required. Too much dependant on team performance.</span></p>
<h2><b>Final words</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reach the desired results throughout the developing procedure it is essential to choose a suitable and appropriate approach first. Don’t hesitate to dedicate time and energy to define your goals and objectives, estimate your budget and set the time limits. It will help you understand which method to turn to if you want to succeed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that nothing works 100%. Every system has its benefits and drawbacks that need to be taken into consideration. For this reason, be careful and scrutinize each and every methodology before selecting one. Hope this article was of great help and now you feel more confident what type of approach will be just right for your team. </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If previous years were mostly marked by the exciting evolution of emerging technologies, 2020 will be different. Technology advances will often be accompanied by various public and private issues that companies and the public will need to consider and deal with. Still, this doesn’t mean 2020 won’t hold anything exciting, or that the big-scale adoption of new technologies will stop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will make projections across 5 technology areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI algorithms in fake news and the future of media</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The not-so-comfortable truth about the state of AR &amp; VR adoption </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endpoint growth, edge computing, and other IoT industry trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial organizations embracing a shared ecosystem</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First steps of face recognition technology in financial services</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many interesting developments to talk about. Let’s start.</span></p>
<h2><strong>AI Trends: Algorithms in Media &amp; Fake News</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media industry has already seen AI-driven virtual TV presenters </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJcdVjkqiW8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The technology paves the way for a potential revolution in the industry, allowing media companies to produce a lot of content on-the-fly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, over the last two years, the public, the media, governmental organizations, and prominent artists have grown increasingly alarmed about how deepfakes can sway opinions online, influencing political events. In 2017, the University of Washington created the notorious </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/01/business/pentagons-race-against-deepfakes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deepfake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmUC4m6w1wo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Barack Obama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there was a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a deepfake video of Mark Zuckerberg, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE1KWpoX9Hk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other examples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The resemblance between the real and fake political figures proved almost uncanny, prompting discussions about the big perils of deepfake technology and other AI uses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, doctored videos can be spotted upon closer examination, but the technology keeps evolving, while easy-to-use deepfake creation tools are available online. Although </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251736/deepfake-propaganda-misinformation-troll-video-hoax" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">current countermeasures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can detect deepfakes and their creators quickly and easily, this may change soon: the technology is evolving, so the countermeasures will need to evolve as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fighting fake articles online will be more challenging, though. MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) has been going to great lengths to showcase the scale of the problem. CSAIL has conducted two scientific investigations (publishing a paper for each in the August of 2019), and both showed that current AI-driven fake news detecting systems, no matter how sophisticated, are not effective enough and face many nuanced challenges.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/15/mit-csail-fights-fake-news-with-ai/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With other companies joining the battle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, (including Facebook), this means that we will definitely see more sophisticated AI tools aimed at reducing the quantity and impact of fake news in 2020 and beyond, across the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The laws will follow suit as well. In 2020, we may expect new deepfake and fake news scandals, hearings on that cases, as well as first instances of comprehensive regulation in the most progressive countries. All popular platforms would use AI algorithms to automatically detect and block deepfakes and fake news, as well as trace their creators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, trends in AI will be a hot topic in 2020.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Augmented &amp; Virtual Reality Trends Slow Down</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although established companies use AR in </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-brands-use-augmented-reality-in-manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacturing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/microsoft-hololens-usage-in-construction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/how-ar-apps-changed-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other industries, the general adoption progresses slowly. Games and gamified customer experiences continue to be the main driver for both AR and VR. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/future-ar-vr-survey/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a survey by XRDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fifty-nine percent of AR and VR projects are game-related. This won’t change anytime soon, at least for VR. Steam will be pushing its </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976234/valve-half-life-alyx-steamvr-index-headset-gaming-storefront-platform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SteamVR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platform with the recently announced Half-Life: Alyx, driving the competition on the VR market. Still, the adoption of both technologies continues to grow steadily in other industries, like education and training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As AR has been growing slowly in the last two years, there is no indication this will change in 2020, despite the release of HoloLens 2 in November 2019. There is the usual back-and-forth in the rumours about Apple’s AR headset, but hard evidence on whatever the company is developing will are non-existent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, we can expect AR to continue breathing new life into familiar experiences. Readers tired of consuming content the old way will definitely enjoy immersive experiences and new story angles enabled by the technology, like those seen in The New York Times </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/augmented-reality" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR/VR section</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and by </span><a href="https://time.com/5628880/time-immersive-app-ar-vr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIME’s new AR/VR app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for other augmented reality trends, the technology will also help ecommerce drive sales in 2020 and beyond. As customers are tired of the same types of ads and their ubiquity, brands will follow into the steps of Instagram (who released its </span><a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spark AR Studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to public this year), building AR catalogues of their goods and creating digital experiences with AR lenses in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR lenses and filters are booming, but they should be approached carefully by development teams in the future. For example, Instagram removed filters that depict or promote cosmetic surgery amid concerns they </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50152053"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harm mental health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR try-in on web pages and in mobile apps would also gain more traction. This option is more cost-effective compared to other AR solutions as well as convenient for users, who would only need to open the camera on their smartphone to try a T-shirt or sunglasses on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002243591930020X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by four UK universities, AR improves decision comfort, prompts users to give positive word-of-mouth recommendations, and drives sales of more expensive products.  </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17616" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1024x683.jpg" alt="augmented reality trends" width="780" height="520" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big-scale adoption of AR will continue in 2020 with products like Adobe’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/adobe-launches-aero-its-ar-authoring-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allows designers to create AR experience without coding easily. The iPad app gives users a step-by-step guide on how to build AR scenes, allowing them to use their existing assets from the Adobe Creative Cloud. The app allows to create basic AR experiences, with the full-fledged version coming to desktop in 2020. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Internet of Things — Adoption Continues  </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the IoT industry trends are connected to streamlining existing IoT-driven operations further, sustating IoT device growth, and building massive ecosystems.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Tapping into IoT Metadata</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last decade, enterprises have been gathering and using data from smart endpoint devices in their IoT ecosystems to a great extent. The next step will be </span><a href="https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/internet-of-things/5-emerging-iot-trends-to-watch-in-2020/3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using that data’s metadata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to drive intelligence systems, increasing the level of personalization further, and giving context to otherwise incomprehensive scenarios in data sets. As a result, the companies will be able to structure unstructured data and improve the process of developing their cognitive systems.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Confident Endpoint Growth</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying on the subject of endpoints, their number will grow in 2020, as devices like smart meters, smart lighting, and smart air conditioning are becoming increasingly common in commercial and residential markets. </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-08-29-gartner-says-5-8-billion-enterprise-and-automotive-io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Gartner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the utilities industry, who is the leader in endpoint usage, was operating 1.17 billion endpoints in 2019, and the firm projects the number will grow by 14.6 percent in 2020, reaching 1.37 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the governmental sector will see a more dramatic spike: from 0.53 billion to 0.70 billion (24.3 percent). The quantity of endpoints will also grow substantially in the building automation and physical security industries. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Other Internet of Things Trends: Edge Computing, Digital Twins</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What else can be expected in the IoT area in 2020? </span><a href="https://www.techcentral.ie/iot-in-2020-awkward-times-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to IDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enterprises will begin transitioning from cloud-based IoT deployments to edge computing to further streamline IoT deployments and application performance in their ecosystems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for big trends in IoT, the Port of Rotterdam, the largest in Europe, has started a massive project of digitizing its every operation, which will continue in 2020. Some parts of the harbor are already automated, but the ports leadership and partners plan to use the digital twin technology and IoT for a complete digital transformation. The end goal is to entirely rid the port of time loss, cargo loss, spills of CO2, and safety incidents. The harbor also wants to berth crewless automated ships somewhere around 2030. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about the port’s plans and progress in detail in the video:</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Port of Rotterdam: Europe&#039;s Strongest Digital Twin Case Study | IoT World Europe 2018 webinar" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_ihbnUuAAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Open &amp; Decentralized Finance</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all likelihood, 2020 will be a watermark year for banks and financial institutions, as they face the inevitability of a large-scale transformation. The concept of open finance — an ecosystem of shared services that converges users and companies in one place to enable better efficiency and experiences — will be the overarching trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that financial organizations will have shared transaction data, IT infrastructure, and cross-compatible systems, while the ecosystem itself will be enabled by distributed technologies and more sophisticated and accessible APIs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed technology will play a key role in the evolution of the entire industry, giving way to decentralized financial services: lending, borrowing, and other financial operations will be provided on decentralized distributed platforms. Banks will use distributed ledgers to issue bonds (</span><a href="https://media.consensys.net/5-sibos-takeaways-the-future-of-finance-according-to-banks-and-institutions-a45fd53298fe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Societe Generale and Santander did</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), as digital markets with tokenized financial instruments will emerge. Payments, meanwhile, will be transferred to permission-based distributed networks to enable high security and speed.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Face Recognition in Financial Services</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As facial recognition is available in more and more smartphones and can help financial organizations cut costs and simplify operations and customer experiences, we can expect more financial services that use face recognition at different customer touchpoints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users will be able to verify different actions related to their accounts in seconds by letting smartphones scan their faces. Still, this will require a high level of security from both the financial institutions, smartphone designers, and software teams behind mobile operating systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of a federated identity — using your face to manage all of your financial operations — is also on the table, but it will take time to evolve. Mexico has </span><a href="https://observer.com/2019/11/trueface-artificial-intelligence-facial-recognition-future-banking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a biometric security mandate to bring this idea to life, so we can probably expect other countries to follow suit in 2020.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Summing Up Technology Trends for 2020</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although major breakthroughs are not in the cards, 2020 will be yet another eventful year for the tech industry and the world. AI will play the most important role at the both sides of the fake news war in 2020, prompting governments to come up with never-before-seen laws. AR adoption has slowed down significantly, and this may continue until Apple releases its first AR device. IoT adoption continues, as companies across industries tap into new types of data, use more endpoints, and find ways to streamline deployments; massive IoT projects like digitization of the Port of Rotterdam are also underway. With no time left to postpone transformation, financial organizations embrace modern times with big plans for setting up shared systems to deliver next-gen user experiences. Finally, face recognition is slowly coming to financial operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s still going to be exciting. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/intellectsoft" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stay tuned</a>.</span></p>
