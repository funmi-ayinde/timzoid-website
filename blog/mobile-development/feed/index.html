								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although iPhone sales slowed down in recent years, one of the biggest and most popular companies in the world hasn’t. Apple continues to improve its ecosystem, finally released a separate OS for iPad, and has maintained its strong stance on privacy.</p>
<p>As the latest WWDC <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18693877/apple-wwdc-2019-privacy-walled-garden-antitrust-developers-app-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showcased</a>, Apple is keen on catering to iOS developers and being a company one would look forward to working with. In fact, a lot has changed for the developers in 2018-2019.</p>
<p>Always keeping track of the latest trends, our developers discuss what’s new in the process of creating software products for iOS and the Apple ecosystem in general. From SwiftUI to addition of reactive libraries to developer program improvements, find out what has changed in the iOS development process in recent years.</p>
<h2>SwiftUI and How Swift Fully Replaces Objective-C</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-18018 size-large" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-1024x601.png" alt="" width="1024" height="601" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-1024x601.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-300x176.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-768x451.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-1536x902.png 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-600x352.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-450x264.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-1000x587.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI.png 1960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Over the years, Swift has been slowly but surely replacing Objective-C as the primary language for iOS app development, and 2019 only cemented Swift as the go-to option for the vast majority of iOS developers. The language helps them build apps from the ground up easily, it is more stable, API management is very comfortable, and there’s binary version compatibility. The list goes on — Xcode IDE is evolving and the developers keep adding new features.</p>
<p>WWDC 2019 also saw Apple announce SwiftUI, a development framework that makes coding on Swift faster. The tool indeed saves the engineers’ a lot of time. Arguably the main feature of SwiftUI is the drag-and-drop editor where developers can add content to the app preview and start building the application without manual typing. Other standout features include automatic support for international languages and dark mode. SwiftUI allows developers to build apps with fewer lines of code for every Apple platform and is easy to use overall.</p>
<h2>Apple Strongly Supports Reactive Programming with Combine Framework</h2>
<p>Today most tech giants face strong criticism from their users and software development partners on a range of important issues. Meanwhile, Apple has taken fewer hits and managed to keep its reputation as a software/technology company and commercial company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18693877/apple-wwdc-2019-privacy-walled-garden-antitrust-developers-app-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost intact</a>, taking a strong stance on user privacy and catering to their development community at WWDC 2019. So, as Swift keeps getting better, Apple also accommodates other developer groups. This includes those who prefer reactive programming. The paradigm is gaining more and more traction as a better way of building interfaces, so Apple had included more libraries for it not long ago, a big plus for many iOS developers.</p>
<h2>Better API Management, New Tech, Prolonged Device Lifecycle</h2>
<p>The evolution of Xcode over the last two years has led to more intuitive and comfortable API management and more possibilities with it in the Apple ecosystem. New prospects were enabled by the emerging technologies as well as Apple’s all-or-nothing approach to quality the company has been both recognized and criticized for — adding features that were long implemented by others but which work like a charm.</p>
<p>For example, adding a document scanning feature into your iOS app is a breeze now; more sophisticated features like face recognition are similarly easy to implement and are well-realized overall. Other tech, like machine learning algorithms, are a pleasure to tinker with in our era of AI-driven smartphone cameras and photography.</p>
<p>Going back to today’s possibilities of Xcode and Apple’s device politics, the company has been addressing the criticism of their products’ short life cycles in the last two years to great success. The latest iPhone models support the first Watch series, iPhones SE is incredibly snappy on iOS 13.3, and so on. Although this means more testing for software teams, it also means they can cater to a wider audience with their products, as not everybody wants or needs to upgrade to the latest Apple device models often.</p>
<h2>Apple’s Ecosystem Slowly Becomes More Open</h2>
<p>Many developers and users had been criticizing Apple for the lack of control they are given in the Apple ecosystem. That started changing in 2017, when the company introduced a file manager in iOS 11. Two years later, in late 2019, Apple also revealed the very first iPadOS, which addressed most of the criticism that was thrown at Apple since the release of their first tablets at the beginning of the decade. This gave both users and developers significantly more space to operate in.</p>
<p>Surely, Apple is not Android, but the company will likely continue giving more possibilities to both users and developers in the years to come, as these and other changes we discussed above indicate. Apple may be aiming at a happy medium, where, on the one hand, they can control the ecosystem to maintain the high level of quality and ensure privacy and security; and on the other, give developers ample space in their development process and for their ideas.</p>
<h2>Easier App Publishing &amp; Developer Program Improvements</h2>
<p>As for other novelties for the iOS app development process, Apple has tweaked its developer program to introduce more automation at its different steps. For example, developers can integrate new Apple technologies to theirs product quickly and seamlessly across all platforms.</p>
<p>Apple has also enhanced app publishing, the step that remains controversial to some developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18693877/apple-wwdc-2019-privacy-walled-garden-antitrust-developers-app-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to this day</a>, with the help of AppStore Connect. As a result, iOS developers can publish apps faster and easier today.</p>
<h2>New Security Measures: Fresh Homekit Protocols, App Permissions, Anti-Bot Measures</h2>
<p>What else the developers working with Apple products need to know? Users can now choose whether an app should ask them to allow their location information every time; in other cases, iOS will allow developers to access the data only when the app needs it function.</p>
<p>Apple has also upped the security of HomeKit with new extended security protocols. For instance, the new Secure Video mode encrypts videos locally before sending the data to the cloud.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s Real User Indicator (RUI), a powerful new feature that notifies developers when a new account user may, in fact, be a bot. Apple has not disclosed what are the precise mechanics of the feature, but the company’s spokesperson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18651359/apple-real-user-indicator-bot-detection-security-feature-ios-13-wwdc-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> during its presentation that RUI uses on-device intelligence to analyze behaviour and generates a value based on which a developer will know whether a new user is a human or bot.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As one of my favorite jokes says, each millennial should ruin a startup, record a podcast, and burn out. Maybe, that won’t be your scenario, but you must have witnessed how contemporary success stories drive masses of entry-level entrepreneurs to at least try that startup idea and launch an app. It promises many inspiring things – like profit generation, positive change expectations, and effective empowerment of the existing business.</p>
<p>However, many people abandon the plan to launch an app once they witness problems in an oversupply of mobile solutions and realize their inability to explain why they fail. At the same time, these reasons are rather objective: either the quality of unsuccessful apps is poor or the essential stages to launch mobile app were violated.</p>
<p>To fix the first issue, you need a team of professionals. But to cure the lack of knowledge about the accurate process to launch an app, you can just read this post.</p>
<p>This comprehensive instruction will help to launch mobile app FOR REAL. It contains 25 steps that can guide you from the raw startup idea to the post-launch maintenance activities of your app:</p>
<p>1. Problem identification<br />
2. Idea choosing<br />
3. Validation<br />
4. Industry research<br />
5. User persona<br />
6. Competitor analysis<br />
7. Positioning<br />
8. Distinguishing main strengths in an app<br />
9. Picking pricing model<br />
10. Branding<br />
11. Landing page publication<br />
12. Completing pre-launch<br />
13. Mockup<br />
14. UI/UX design<br />
15. Coding<br />
16. Beta-testing<br />
17. Gathering tools for data collection<br />
18. App release<br />
19. Rating check<br />
20. Adjusting keywords<br />
21. Publishing early testimonials<br />
22. Working with social media accounts and communities<br />
23. Media outreach company<br />
24. App promotion<br />
25. Reengaging activities</p>
<p>Let’s check how to make each this step right. Rely on the experience of digital geniuses to make your app idea work and impress the world!</p>
<h2>STAGE 1. Accurate planning</h2>
<h3>Step #1. Identify the problem your app will solve</h3>
<p>Many developers not just forget to start from problem identification – they disregard this step completely. By doing this, they make one of the biggest mistakes ever: they face the failure of an overall initiative to launch an app.</p>
<p>That’s why we recommend each young entrepreneur to consider problem-solving approach seriously. Before you let your mind captured by your brilliant ideas or start working on the product itself, calm yourself down by asking, “Which customer pain I want to solve?”. This simple mental exercise can awesomely direct your efforts from making another useless mobile app to something worthy and needed by people.</p>
<p>Once you concentrate on launching a mobile solution (and not just an empty app), even the atmosphere in which you launch mobile app changes. It gifts an additional shot of inspiration, increased motivation, and a sense of purpose – both to yourself and your team.</p>
<p>While identifying customer pain, stick to the basic principle of thinking big and acting small. That will help you accumulate all the necessary experience and suffer from minimum losses. And prepare you to make a really significant change.</p>
<h3>Step #2. Find a good idea</h3>
<p>Once you’ve defined the customer pain you will solve, it’s time to brainstorm ideas. Collect and weigh as many thoughts as possible to make sure the one you’ll choose is the best of the best.</p>
<p>Here’s the way how to make it carefully:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the very beginning, try to gather as many bad ideas as possible. Aim at reaching 100 points in your list of terrible solutions to that sharp problem you’ve noticed on Step #1. Don’t limit your imagination – usually, the great idea appears somewhere between 20th and 80th position. Just don’t stop exploring and creating!</li>
<li>To get some extra inspiration while stuck, investigate forums and thematic groups in social media. Don’t be shy to start conversations with people and test your ideas (or ask strangers for theirs) while talking to those facing the identified pain.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you finally picked a couple of great ideas with which you can launch mobile app, scrutinize them by asking these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which actions can lead your product to come into the market?</li>
<li>What makes your solution special?</li>
<li>Why should people download your app?</li>
<li>Are you able to develop a sustainable business plan to make it work?</li>
<li>Is it easy to steal and/or copy your idea? How can you protect yourself from this harm?</li>
</ol>
<p>If your idea can stand such interrogation under duress, you can move forward!</p>
<h3>Step #3. Validate your idea</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18083" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-200x300.jpeg" alt="How to launch an app Validate your idea" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-600x900.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-300x450.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-667x1000.jpeg 667w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea.jpeg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>To complete the planning stage, create a low-tech prototype you can touch and test. You don’t have to make it detailed and tech-savvy! That’s a technological representation of an app purpose you’ve created in your head, nothing more. On this stage, you just need to check whether everything you’ve identified in your idea checklist can be reflected in the form of a digital solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>STAGE 2. Conducting research</h2>
<h3>Step #4. Investigate the industry</h3>
<p>Before you dive into the development stage and actually launch mobile app, learning the market context is none the worse for. To conduct industry research, play with Google Keyword Planner and AppAnnie tools. SEO and PPC specialists frequently use them, and there’s no surprise – these instruments provide you with useful insights into what people search in Google and which keywords are relevant for your specific market niche. Lucky you, that’s the basic information to launch an app too.</p>
<h3>Step #5. Create a user persona</h3>
<p>In addition to understanding the market, it’s essential to know your customers well. Spend a fair amount of time to learn their demographical traits, tastes, typical behaviors, and attitudes. All these data will make your users attracted by the product you’ll create for them.</p>
<p>After you’ve collected all the relevant information, create the user persona. This method makes you think of an ideal client – the one who contains the most typical features and reveals the most common patterns you’ve identified.</p>
<p>Here’s the process of how to work on user persona:</p>
<ol>
<li>Include raw data: age, location, specification, relationship status, etc;</li>
<li>Draft a typical bio to create the story of your user persona;</li>
<li>Add sections with wishes, needs, and common fears to capture the emotional portrait;</li>
<li>Include relevant skills and specifications;</li>
<li>List favorite brands, food, and places (or any other details relevant for your research).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step #6. Analyze competitors</h3>
<p>Finally, you won’t get the full picture of the context without checking the behavior and business tactics of your main rivals. The easiest way to search for your key competitors is to read Google articles dedicated to the top 10 companies in your niche. Your direct competitors are those several ones that appear the most frequently.</p>
<p>While researching your competitors, ask them these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Who are their target users?</li>
<li>Why are they so popular?</li>
<li>Which exact keywords make their ranking that high?</li>
<li>What do customer reviews say?</li>
<li>What did they look over (and so, my app can improve)?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Collecting these answers will make you confident about the cheerful prospects of your future success!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18084 size-large" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-1024x683.jpeg" alt="How to launch an app - Analyze competitors" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Analyze-competitors.jpeg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>STAGE 3. App launch marketing plan</h2>
<h3>Step #7. Develop Positioning Statement</h3>
<p>So, once you’ve convinced yourself and your market that an idea created in your head should see the world, it’s time to start marketing! The proper start is to create your positioning statement that addresses three main questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who will use my app?</li>
<li>What advantage does it bring to these people?</li>
<li>Why is this app more valuable to my users than all the other apps available?</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve elaborated your answers to these questions, all the marketing steps you’d take in the future should empower that statement – again and again. That will contribute to your brand awareness.</p>
<p>Remember: your task is to create something special, valuable, and different from all those millions of apps available in AppStore. Dedicate maximum attention to creating your Unique Value Proposition – that’s the phrase that will hook your target audience and convince them to stay with you. And yes, never deceive your positioning statement ever after.</p>
<h3>Step #8. Define your main strengths</h3>
<p>The completion with other apps will be cruel, so you need to spend some time designing the list of all the counterarguments you will use to fight them all.</p>
<p>For useful insights, refer to these two sources of information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Competitor’s reviews. Learn the key problems other apps reaching your target customers have experienced – and solve them in your solution.</li>
<li>Marketing channels missed. If your competitors don’t use YouTube, blogs, or Product Hunt – well, you know what does it mean for you, right?</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, pay attention to the most common pricing models, the level of customer satisfaction, and the frequency and quality of version updates. On all these weaknesses, you can build your power.</p>
<h3>Step #9. Choose the best pricing model</h3>
<p>Depending on the aims of your app and the expectations your target customers carry, you can use different approaches to asking for money in your app. The most common model is “freemium,” which means that users are granted free access to the limited version of a product, but its full functionality is available upon subscription. Alternatively, you can go for free, subscription-based, or in-app purchases models.</p>
<p>To make the final decision, consider the size of your audience: if it’s a niche market, you can risk and launch an app that is downloaded for money. If your task is to reach maximum people, that’s possible with a free solution only.</p>
<h3>Step #10. Develop branded screenshots and visuals for marketing</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18085" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-300x200.jpeg" alt="How to launch an app - Develop branded screenshots and visuals for marketing" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing.jpeg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Complete pre-marketing activities by developing the brand book of your app. It doesn’t mean designing a comprehensive mobile marketing campaign – but you need to notify about the app release date and construct the overall brand awareness from scratch.</p>
<p>Never miss the chance to tell the story of your app. Design various beautiful visuals with the emotional appeal in different formats – you can use them as materials for press, social media banners, creative elements in the e-mail marketing campaigns, etc. Also, pay attention to the promo video. With it, you can both introduce your product and reengage customers over and over again (in social media posts, on a landing page, and in the description on AppStore).</p>
<p>Complete the package you’ll send to influencers and press. In its visual part, it should include a logo, an icon, screenshots, and the promo.</p>
<h2>STAGE 4. Pre-Launch Activities</h2>
<h3>Step #11. Publish a landing page for your app</h3>
<p>Even though your efforts are mostly connected with the need to launch a mobile app, don’t underestimate the potential of a website in empowering your success. Generally, a landing page can help you in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>It facilitates checking whether your idea is really profitable and viable,</li>
<li>It enables collecting e-mails of your first clients and communicating with them,</li>
<li>It’s useful for lead generation,</li>
<li>It’s effective in showcasing all the product advantages, customer reviews, and press references.</li>
</ol>
<p>To create a landing page, register your domain, fill all the relevant information, and add a submission form for your visitors to leave their e-mails. To make it quick, use the services like Instapage, Wix, LaunchRock, and Unbounce. Also, don’t forget to link your landing page with services for data collection and analytics – you won’t regret having direct access to Google Analytics and Optimizely.</p>
<p>Use your landing page to pitch your app idea, share private beta versions to test your product on its development stage, communicate its positioning and strengths, and promote it on a post-launch stage!</p>
<h3>Step #12. Complete all the preparations to app launch campaign</h3>
<p>At this stage, you complete all the warming up before diving into the hard development. Use all the information you’ve gathered to complete the pre-launch checklist!</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete the product description page. Use all the information you’ve gathered on the previous steps to create a catching text that describes your app to clients. It should work for the perfect advertising of your app.</li>
<li>Determine the main influencers in your industry and establish communication with them. Don’t underestimate the role of networking and communication – especially if you just entered the market with the new product.</li>
<li>Craft app promotion campaign. Create the list of advertising activities you’ll launch in various marketing channels – social media, communication with bloggers, traditional advertising platforms, and the way your website will work.</li>
<li>Prepare a press kit. Create a directory that contains the most powerful information about your app (both visual and textual), the list of all the platforms where you’re present (website, forums, social media), and your contact information. Send it to press representatives.</li>
</ol>

<h2>STAGE 5. Development</h2>
<h3>Step #13. Create the mockup</h3>
<p>So, everything is ready to start developing your product! For one thing, create a basic sketch of your product. Omit using mixed colors and including sophisticated heavy details – all you need to do is to outline the main blocks and their connections. Aim at creating a general perspective with the basic interactions and overall app flow on this step.</p>
<p>Here’s the process of creating a mockup:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Write down basic app functionality and user interface features your digital solution must have</li>
<li>Create a series of screens for each element</li>
<li>Draft requirements for UI – include general elements first, then add some essential details</li>
<li>Add supporting notes with explanations where needed</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The mockup is like a pencil sketch, not a complete picture. Prefer blue-sky thinking about general concepts to down-to-earth back-breaking detail-drawing. You’re just preparing yourself.</p>
<h3>Step #14. Apply graphic design</h3>
<p>That’s where your maximum attention to the details is the main requirement. Your final task is to show how the app will look – from point to point, in a complete color palette, and containing all the layouts and UI elements. That’s the step where each centimeter and each pixel matter.</p>
<p>And that’s a high time to invite UX/UI professional. Only this specialist can complete this task as well as your app needs. Don’t skimp and save here – the major part of your success depends on the beauty and usability of UI/UX design specifically.</p>
<h3>Step #15. Code</h3>
<p>This is another hard-working step that is a prerequisite to the appearance of your app. Similar to the case of the design, the importance of coding calls for the best programming specialist you can find.</p>
<p>Think of the number of platforms you’re aiming at. You can launch an app for iOS or Android (good native coding platforms Xcode and Swift). Alternatively, you can invest in cross-platform solutions – here, pay attention to React Native, Flutter, and Xamarin as useful tools. Finally, check out Parse.com and Firebase – they are great backend-as-a-service instruments to work with data assets.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to check the guidelines of the platforms you’ve chosen – to ensure the submission process will go smoothly and bug-free.</p>
<h3>Step #16. Beta-test</h3>
<p>The more features and platforms your app needs, the greater the importance of beta-testing. Precisely, it’s necessary to fix as many problems as possible before you launch your mobile app – otherwise, the whole product can alienate your target customers once and for long. So, always check your progress through both internal and external testing of your app. Reach your fans, friends, and even friends of your friends to collect all the data and testimonials needed to ensure you’ll celebrate your launch, not save your solution from losses and bugs. Try TestFlight, a solution that allows beta testing of your app both internally and externally.</p>
<p>Of course, all this doesn’t mean that beta-testing will save your product from ALL the glitches you’ll notice after the release. You just need to make sure you’ve done everything possible to prevent those bugs and mistakes that appear in the early development stages.</p>
<h3>Step #17. Prepare technical tools to leverage audience and collect data on your app</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-18087 size-medium" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-200x300.jpeg" alt="How to launch an app - Prepare technical tools to leverage audience and collect data on your app" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-600x900.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-300x450.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-667x1000.jpeg 667w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app.jpeg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>We highly recommend developing in-app messaging in advance. This will help you collect precious feedback – both on the beta-testing step and long after the launch.</p>
<p>Also, connect services that will help you work with analytics right before launching. For this purpose, the best picks are Crashlink (to work with crashes), Google Analytics (to measure engagement), and Fastlane (for better automation).</p>
<p>Aaaand… are you ready for the next long-expected step?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>STAGE 6. Launch mobile app</h2>
<h3>Step #18. Your time to launch an app came!</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18088" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Your-time-to-launch-an-app-came-200x300.jpeg" alt="How to launch an app - Your time to launch an app came" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Your-time-to-launch-an-app-came-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Your-time-to-launch-an-app-came-600x900.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Your-time-to-launch-an-app-came-300x450.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Your-time-to-launch-an-app-came-667x1000.jpeg 667w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Your-time-to-launch-an-app-came.jpeg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>It’s already Step #18, but that finally happened. It’s time to celebrate launching an app!</p>
<p>The vital task here is to let everybody you can reach know the news and open the champagne to celebrate this happening with your team!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>STAGE 7. Post-launch activities</h2>
<h3>Step #19. Keep track of your rating</h3>
<p>In the first couple of weeks, don’t lose your sense of reality and constantly check your performance. For this, rely on prepared KPIs and work with the metrics on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In the beginning, get ready to face high volatility in your rankings. Simply get track of rating, reviews, the number of downloads, and retention rate. This objective information will help you see the bigger picture and provide a sustainable background for the first updates.</p>
<h3>Step #20. Immediately adjust your keywords (if needed)</h3>
<p>Among the prior changes on the post-launch stage, prepare to revise the keywords. Having a tremendous impact on your ranking in both AppStore and Google Play, keywords, if changed on time, can improve your position dramatically.</p>
<p>Among the fields to revise, pay attention to the app’s title, the list of meta keywords, and meta description. The make all the difference.</p>
<h3>Step #21. Get early testimonials</h3>
<p>For the post-launch stage, it’s all about reviews. You should provoke, collect, and process them. At the same time, we recommend not only checking the reviews left by your customers but also adjust your description with the best examples. Doing this can increase trust to you and boost popularity – especially if you get somebody like Leonardo di Caprio among your reviewers!</p>
<p>Just don’t be shy and ask influencers and celebrities for the review by yourself! Both critics and fans contribute to your success. Besides, they attract new users who judge your product by reading reviews and scanning descriptions – so update the review list and description info as often as it’s needed to make it perfect!</p>
<h3>Step #22. Develop social media accounts and reach existing online communities</h3>
<p>Among the most important areas to develop on the post-launch stage, pay attention to users who gather in social media, blogs, and forums. Link your social accounts to your landing page so that your audience can reach you on both platforms. Invest in social media and content marketing – but do it wisely. Be active in thematic Facebook groups and on Instagram. Talk to your customers and search for immediate insights into your market. And also, keep an eye on influencers in your industry and develop strategical partnerships.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to use social media for your app. Don’t neglect their potential!</p>
<h3>Step #23. Work on media outreach strategy</h3>
<p>Along with working on social media, it’s crucial to establish beneficial communication with the press. In this context, rely on the value of your product and your unique selling points. By building relations with journalists and bloggers, communicate your story to build sincere connections. To find your audience, use Google News, Reverse Google Image Search, and Help-A-Reporter-Out (HARO).</p>
<p>And never forget to show them your awesome brand book!</p>
<h3>Step #24 Promote your app</h3>
<p>Marketing strategy constantly supplements your app launch – but it gets the solemnity on the post-launch stage. You can do many things here – and reviewing them deserves a separate post.</p>
<p>That’s why we list you just some ideas for you to investigate and get more target customers:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Participate in the curated lists,</li>
<li>Apply paid advertising,</li>
<li>Try App Store Optimization (ASO),</li>
<li>Use push notification,</li>
<li>Use A/B testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step #25 Reengage your users</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18089" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-300x200.jpeg" alt="How to launch an app - Reengage your users" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users.jpeg 1051w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Finally, you should never forget about the people who already chose to stay with your app. Entertain them with new content and fresh updates. Keep an eye on their behavior. Remain the perfect app for their needs.</p>
<p>And, of course, carefully listen and instantly react to the feedback you receive from your fans. From the very beginning, you initiated an app to solve their problem – so, at the end of the app launch journey, you should always stick to this purpose to not only keep your ratings high but also ensure you create value.</p>
<h2>Final note: How much does it cost to launch an app?</h2>
<p>If we reached our aim of writing this post, the task of launching an app should not seem hard for you anymore. The only thing to cover is the revealing the amount of resources you’ll need to start.</p>
<p>This answer depends on many factors: the app type you want to develop, the exact number of platforms, design sophistication, databases used, the appearance of adds-on, etc. With the different combinations of these factors, the sum can range from $10,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p>So, it’s always better to contact the development team and get the real price from them. Compare different teams to make the final choice.</p>
<p>We wish good luck with your app launch – and let you open many bottles of champagne for success!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As apps for mental health are becoming more popular and the market is far from being saturated, building a mental health app may well become your next successful venture. To give you an understanding of what the market looks like and its many nuances, we hand-picked the best mental health apps available right now and pinpointed what made them succeed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We did not include Headspace and Calm, as these are highly popular and well-advertised applications, instead opting to focus on unique mental health apps recognized across different categories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lets’ start.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>BlueIce</strong> </span></h2>
<h3><strong>Category: Evidence based mental health apps for youth and kids</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlueIce is aimed at helping teenagers manage their emotions and prevent self-harm with a wide variety of different features. Available for both Apple and Android devices, the application was developed by Paul Stallard from Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust (Foundation Trusts are NHS’s organizations with a strong local reach). To make it as effective as possible, teenager with lived experience of self-harm took part in the process of creating BlueIce.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first relies on a “mood wheel”: a user chooses how they feel from a wide range of options on the wheel, take short notes, and then can identify mood patterns and triggers in the Mood Calendar across long periods of time. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17542" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-595x1024.png" alt="evidence based mental health apps" width="291" height="501" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-595x1024.png 595w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-174x300.png 174w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-768x1321.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-600x1032.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-262x450.png 262w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-582x1000.png 582w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot.png 1241w" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlueIce’s trial showed that the app can help teenagers manage their stress levels and self-harm urges alongside traditional face-to-face communication with a mental health professional. This and its comprehensive approach make BlueIce one of the top mental health apps available. The application is free, but prescription-only.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Cove</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Category: Music Apps For Mental Health</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone will enjoy writing down their thoughts into a mood journal, looking for other ways to improve well-being. Highly praised by top publications like Wired, The Next Web, and Guardian, the Cove app address that by offering simple music-making tools and eye-pleasing visuals designed for reducing anxiety and stress through self-expression. The process is easy: a user selects one of the six moods and then taps to choose chords, melody, and instruments (more than thirty are available) to create their own songs.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17544" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cove-App-Screenshot.jpg" alt="music mental health apps" width="375" height="501" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cove-App-Screenshot.jpg 643w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cove-App-Screenshot-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cove-App-Screenshot-600x801.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cove-App-Screenshot-337x450.jpg 337w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cove was developed with the help of clinicians and other medical experts as well as tested, evaluated, and trialed in the NHS and other health organizations. Although Cove won’t replace professional treatment, it can be used alongside talking therapy and counselling, or simply to relax for a few minutes and enjoy the process of creating music anywhere you find comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users have met Cove with high praise, mentioning its therapeutic effect, that it helps to cope with negative thinking, and has easy-on-the-eye visuals. As for the media, Guardian called it one of the best medical apps, and Wired UK wrote that Cove will upend user expectations when it comes to what a journaling app can be (Cove can be referred to as a music journaling app). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app is available for free for iOS devices only. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Xmed Health</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Category: Social Media-like Apps for Mental Health </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although social media platforms have grown to be stress-inducing for many users, people’s love for socializing online can channeled to alleviate modern stressors and solve other mental health issues. The </span><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/cases/xmed-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xmed app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may be the best example of that, offering users a health and lifestyle mobile ecosystem, a social network, and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in one package.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is how it works: AI asks a series of questions to identify a user’s health issue, juxtaposes that data with available medical data and information provided by other app users, and arrives at a conclusion. The user can then start talking with certified mental health professionals to tackle the problem, as well as discuss it with people who have the same issue in the app’s in-built social media network. </span></p>

<h2><strong>My Possible Self</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Categories: Mental health therapy apps, Mental health tracking apps</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Possible Self promises to help its users lower stress and anxiety levels in eight weeks with a range of features backed up by clinically approved content. To deliver on the promise, the app offers over a wide range of learning modules aimed at various stress-inducing situations in life. </span></p>
<p><b>The modules include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress and overload management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fear and anxiety management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overcoming loss and big life changes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem solving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happiness and well-being management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tackling negative thinking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning to pleasant activities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving daily communication</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list does not end there, as the app’s creators continuously update it with different new modules. The first learning module is free, but to access the rest users needs to have a subscription. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17546" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/MyPossibleSelf-App-Insights-Screen.png" alt="mental health therapy apps" width="331" height="502" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/MyPossibleSelf-App-Insights-Screen.png 392w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/MyPossibleSelf-App-Insights-Screen-198x300.png 198w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/MyPossibleSelf-App-Insights-Screen-296x450.png 296w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the app has a number of other aspects that make it one of the best mental health apps. There is a comprehensive </span><b>mood tracking tool/dairy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, created with the help of the company’s in-house psychologists. A user can track their mood daily, selecting how they feel and pinpointing activities, people, and places that influence their mood and well-being. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working alongside the tracking tool is the </span><b>Mood History</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Insights </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">features that help users detect mood patterns and act accordingly to improve how they feel. The latter displays mood shifts in a comprehensive chart, showing the patterns and proposing potentially suitable lifestyle changes with the help of custom algorithms. What is more, users can add written notes and images to every mood entry — a small but nice touch that enriches the experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The content used in My Possible Self is clinically and statistically proven to lower stress and improve well-being in an eight weeks’ time. To ensure that, the creators partnered with a leading non-profit mental health research facility called The Black Dog Institute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Possible Self was warmly received by users and praised by media outlets like London Evening Standard and Buzzfeed. Is is available both in the Appstore and Google Play.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Happify</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Categories: Event based mental health apps, Gamified mental health apps</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happify has a lot to offer. The app uses a set of comprehensive features that rely on science-based games and activities to help users fight stress consistently across all life areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the app’s centre are </span><b>Tracks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a section with stretches of different simple activities that help users improve their well-being on a daily basis. These include, for example, singling out small moments in your day that made you feel good and choosing a person to be thankful to. Every user has a progression scale for each track as well as six skills they upgrade by completing it: Savor, Thank, Aspire, Give, Empathize, and Revive. There over sixty available tracks for different aspects of life, part of them only through subscription.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17547" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Happify-Tracks-Screen.png" alt="gamified mental health apps" width="298" height="554" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Happify-Tracks-Screen.png 298w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Happify-Tracks-Screen-161x300.png 161w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Happify-Tracks-Screen-242x450.png 242w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who want small bits instead of a long progression, there is an </span><b>Instant Play</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section. Here, users can complete activities separately for each of the aforementioned skills. </span></p>
<p><b>Other features include: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Happify Daily</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — articles, videos, infographics, and other types of content related to improving emotional well-being</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Community</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a minimalist social network users can choose to be part of and share the activities completed for the skills with others</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Negative Knockout</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a game where you bring down your negative emotions in style of Angry Birds.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature list is bigger still. For example, the app offers a twenty-page character strength report for each user, compiled in partnership with The VIA Institute. Meanwhile, Happify’s approaches were developed by leading scientists and experts in positive psychology, cognitive behavioural therapy, and mindfulness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happify was widely praised by users and media, including reviews in ABC World News and The New York Times. The company also claims that eight-six percent of their regular users report improved well-being in two month since they started using the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happify is available for iOS and Android. Part of the features are free, while the rest can be accessed by subscribing. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What Makes Top Mental Health Succeed</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a pattern to why the aforementioned mental health apps enjoy success — they all tick the same important boxes. Here are the success factors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health professionals should be involved in as many stages as possible</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app should have a diverse set of features for a user to choose from </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The features should be backed up by scientific research</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app should have its unique feature, or approach a common feature from a different angle</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood journal is an important feature</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gamification helps to keep the users engaged</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app should have an appealing design</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have taken a closer look at the top apps for mental health and what makes them so, you can start planning your own unique mobile product for those who want to tackle their mental health issues in a handy, clear, and pleasant way.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing popularity of smartphones over recent years has changed how people read news and articles forever. In a change-or-die situation, media companies needed to adapt fast, creating comprehensive digital strategies. As smartphones became the cornerstone of our everyday lives, mobile apps needed to be at the center of those strategies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, many news apps showcase that a life without print editions and newstands (or only a small number of them), which might come sooner than later, may not be something readers and media companies should be concerned about. If they are properly made, news apps not only carry over the look and feel of newspapers and magazines to mobile, they also give the media new ways and angles to provide coverage, in one place and to a global reader base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five hand-picked news apps that deliver on that promise today. Use our list to get inspired for your own news app, find yourself a new news sources, or simply explore examples of all-around great mobile products. </span></p>
<h2><strong>The New York Times (iOS)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you prefer paper editions of newspapers over news apps, it is hard to deny that the New York Times did a great job of carrying over their long-established aesthetic and reporting to mobile. It is just that: the same New York Times, only more visually appealing and handy and available anywhere you want to read it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user experience and design are outstanding: sections are well-organized (with quick access to Saved for Later and Recently Viewed), navigation is quick and simple, and the app’s clean visuals are really easy on the eye. Whether you want to quickly read the morning briefing or enjoy evening articles from the newspaper’s many sections, you will have a pleasant experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything’s good under the hood as well: there are no crashes and bugs, and the pages load quite quickly even with poor internet connection. The app has ads, but they are non-intrusive and fit into the design organically. </span></p>

<!-- #tablepress-4 from cache -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to sections, the New York Times app has it all: from the standard Opinion, World, Business and sport — to sections on health and wellness, entertainment and arts, as well as video and podcasts, among many others. You can also access the day’s paper in the corresponding section. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a well-produced “Immersive” section that is dedicated to AR and VR news content, the NYT doubles down on the notion that mobile and digital technology hold the potential to give new life to the media by giving readers new exciting perspectives and angles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Readers can access a limited number of articles for free every month or subscribe to one of the plans.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Al Jazeera English</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from its appealing and intuitive design, what makes the Al Jazeera app stand out is the emphasis on live news. They are quickly accessible in a video or audio stream and equally comfortable to watch on a smartphone or tablet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al Jazeera understands the needs of modern users better than other media companies: the app has two more video sections alongside the Live broadcast — on-demand programming and documentaries. Other sections feature top stories, latest news, and  opinion pieces. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17250 " src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-606x1024.png" alt="Al Jazeera news app" width="526" height="889" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-606x1024.png 606w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-178x300.png 178w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-600x1013.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-266x450.png 266w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-592x1000.png 592w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231.png 639w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can personalize your feed in the “My Feed” section, which provide quick access to bookmarked topics, saved pages, and programmes. That being said, navigating Al Jazeera English is a breeze. Even on smaller screens, there is a lot of breathing space, and the sections are well-organized in general. </span></p>
<p><b>Sections include</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Arts &amp; Culture, Business &amp; Economy, Environment, Poverty &amp; Development, Human Rights and more, as well as a separate section that covers different regions of the world. Readers can also access archived content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al Jazeera English is free-of-charge. </span></p>
<h2><strong>New Yorker Today</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the New York Times, The New Yorker magazine has managed to go mobile with great success. Capturing the look and feel of the magazine really well, New Yorker Today serves three goals: delivers the latest news, opinion pieces, articles, and writing; provide quick access to the decade-spanning library ot its widely celebrated cartoons; give fast access to the magazine library with the latest and archive issues.</span></p>

<table id="tablepress-3" class="tablepress tablepress-id-3">
<tbody class="row-hover">
<tr class="row-1 odd">
	<td class="column-1"><img src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-New-Yorker-Today-Screenshot-1-e1570039979160-595x1024.png" alt="New Yorker Today News App" width="595" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17251" /></td><td class="column-2"><img src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-New-Yorker-Screenshot-2-e1570040009372-595x1024.png" alt="New Yorker Today news app" width="595" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17252" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<!-- #tablepress-3 from cache -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although its website and magazine app can stand on their own and can be used separately, New Yorker Today seems to be aimed at readers who want to access the most popular parts of the The New Yorker’s digital experience in one place. </span></p>
<p><b>Sections:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latest news and writing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartoon randomizer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital edition of the magazine (differs from the magazine app)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bookmarks and history</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a limited number of free-to-read articles and a range of subscription options available for readers.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Pocket</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as news apps go, Pocket is not a typical media product. At its heart is a simple promise of letting users save articles and web pages for later reading and viewing, but it delivers on it to the fullest. If you read news alongside articles from different publications, but do not want to assault your eyes with the endless stream of headlines of news aggregator apps (or simply find the look and feel of Instapper uninspiring), Pocket will your top choice.</span></p>

<table id="tablepress-5" class="tablepress tablepress-id-5">
<tbody class="row-hover">
<tr class="row-1 odd">
	<td class="column-1"><img src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pocket-Web-App-Screenshot-e1570040455244-618x1024.png" alt="Pocket news app" width="618" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17259" /></td><td class="column-2"><img src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pocket-App-Screenshot-e1570040471323-597x1024.png" alt="" width="597" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17260" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<!-- #tablepress-5 from cache -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket is integrated with all popular browsers on desktop and mobile and with over fifteen thousand apps, making it quick and simple to save articles anywhere you find them. There are many instruments for managing them too. You can always locate the right article quickly with tags and a number of sections — all put together nicely in an extremely comfortable-to-use design. Other features include choosing the background color and highlighting text, listening to any article, and following friends to find out what they are reading.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this comes for free, but you can get extra features like advanced search and fonts with the paid premium version. There is also a section of curated articles from numerous different publications updated everyday as well as a tool to look for them yourself across different categories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket is continuously updated, bug-free, and the user experience is equally satisfying in the web app and native apps (although you cannot listen to articles in the web app). Interestingly, It is in-built into the Firefox browser and is owned by its creators, the Mozilla Corporation. </span></p>
<h2><b>TechCrunch</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shiny look and handy navigation of TechCrunch’s website can be enjoyed in any browser, but you might just opt for the publication’s app instead. It bares the visual style of the website, but provides a more focused, personalised, and ad-free experience. </span></p>

<table id="tablepress-6" class="tablepress tablepress-id-6">
<tbody class="row-hover">
<tr class="row-1 odd">
	<td class="column-1"><img src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/TechCrunch-App-Screenshot-e1570040577401-606x1024.png" alt="TechCrunch tech news app" width="606" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17263" /></td><td class="column-2"><img src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/TechCrunch-Screenshot-2-e1570040612672-608x1024.png" alt="TechCrunch tech news app" width="608" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17264" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<!-- #tablepress-6 from cache -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the latest tech news with the TechCrunch app is easy, fast, and comfortable. You can browse the headlines of the latest news and bookmark them right in the feed. One more section gathers topics of your choice in one place, and you can manage or stay notified about them right in this section. Finally, there is “Saved for Later,” where you can read the bookmarked articles. You can also access the latest TechCrunch videos at the beginning of the main feed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, the TechCrunch app streamlines reading tech news to the maximum, delivering a snappy experience without ads, bugs, and free-of-charge. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media — WeAre8 </span></h2>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile — App Platform Mobile Roadie</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2009, Mobile Roadie is the first Do-it-Yourself (DIY), no-code app builder in the history of software development. Its creators recognized that mobile will become a powerful marketing tool, creating a universal, rich-featured, and intuitive app builder for businesses across industries. Mobile Roadie is still highly popular today, powering ups apps of Madonna, Dallas Mavericks, Wynn Las Vegas, San Diego Zoo, and more. </span></p>
<p><b><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17180" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-1024x561.png" alt="digital marketing tools" width="1024" height="561" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-1024x561.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-300x164.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-768x421.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-600x329.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-450x247.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-1000x548.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></b></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beacons, and other features</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, a business gets a mobile presence, a set of engagement tools, and means to learn more about their users — faster and at a fraction of the cost as compared to custom software development. If a company wants to go above and beyond with their app, they can hire the Mobile Roadie team to do custom development as part of three different packages aimed at the look, functionality, and business needs.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content Marketing — Unsplash</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it is an enterprise or a new neighbourhood restaurant in New York City, Unsplash is a real find for marketing efforts in any company. If the inherent mediocrity of the likes of Shutterstock tires you, or producing quality visuals and photos for your content takes more time than your team has, Unsplash provides just the right solution. </span></p>
<p><b><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17181" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-1024x561.png" alt="online marketing tools" width="1024" height="561" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-1024x561.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-300x164.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-768x421.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-600x329.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-450x247.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-1000x548.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free of charge to this day, Unsplash started out as a place where professional, amateur and mobile photographers as well as visual artists uploaded their photos, both sharing and promoting their work (the user is always reminded to copyright the author when they download a picture, but it is not obligatory). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the start, Unsplash reminded a more slick and elevated version of Instagram without comments and influencers, where you could browse beautiful photos, finding something for a social media page of a small business like a coffee shop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it successfully saved that allure, today’s Unsplash can cover the needs of the vast majority of industries, from embedded software development to building construction to island festivals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need a crisp, attention-grabbing image, Unsplash is a go-to platform: you can always find something to make your blog or social media post stand out from the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsplash is also a forward-thinking platform: the like count was removed and the newly introduced monetization is organic, as businesses put advertising in Unsplash-styled photos in an intrusive way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Unsplash is just a pleasure to use wherever you click. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voice Advertising — Spotify Ad Studio</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world that overwhelms your customers with visual information from all sides and screens, voice advertising is having a big moment alongside the enduring popularity of podcasts and music streaming. A properly put together voice ad is not only effective, but less intrusive as compared to different types of visual ads filling the numerous screens of your users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify for Brands</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ad suite, Spotify Ad Studio is a self-service audio ad platform that lets brands create great ads in three easy steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an ad. You can pass the script to the Spotify team, and they will record a voiceover, mix the music, and produce it at no extra cost. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audience targeting. You target users based on their age, gender, location, activity, music or podcast taste, as well as choose on what platforms to air it. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campaign customization. The last thing you need to do to launch the campaign is set a budget and dates. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key platforms include mobile tablet, desktop, web. Platforms like gaming console, connected TV, and connected car are available in some markets.  </span></p>
<p><iframe title="Spotify Ad Studio: Why Advertise on Spotify?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Lu4UfR6oNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also two advertising options aimed at Spotify Free users. With </span><b>interest targeting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, brands can engage users based on activities and topics they like (determined by their podcast, playlists, and platform preferences). The feature works in three categories — comedy, technology, and cooking. The second one is </span><b>real-time context targeting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing brands to reach users at specific moments during the day, like a morning run or dinner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a twenty-nine million ad-supported users and a set of measurement tools, Spotify Ad Studio may be a fitting choice for your next voice ad campaign. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross Platform Ad Management — Adobe Primetime</span></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17183" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Primetime.png" alt="business marketing tools" width="336" height="336" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Primetime.png 218w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Primetime-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today users watch TV on their mobile devices anywhere they want, as the classic TV experience has become a thing of the past. With advanced data tools and technology available, new advertising opportunities for broadcast and cable networks and other TV providers amount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe’s advertising platform Primetime helps TV providers and their partners in a number of ways:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uses data and machine learning to help TV providers know their viewers better, improving ad targeting across platforms. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creates smooth and personalized ad experiences without buffering and playback errors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enables the providers to enforce intelligent authentication rules, reducing account sharing and driving revenue.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allows TV providers to operate at scale, ensuring reliable ad insertion at massive live events like the Superbowl.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allows for delivering video across all platforms in a single workflow and ensures consistent ad delivery across all screens.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe Primetime is used by the vast majority of TV companies in North America. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the process of creating any mobile or web application, you should make sure every component is well-built. Even the smallest problems that may arise in the process of creating a mobile app architecture can undermine the quality of the final result. As the saying goes, if you want to do something, do it well. This is why every popular Android and iOS application has a highly reliable mobile app architecture and successfully wins over its users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is mobile app architecture? It is a set of structural elements and their interfaces from which the system is composed, as well as their behavior in the framework of all structural elements. It can be said that this is the skeleton of a program and the whole work of the mobile application is determined by its quality. By missing an important element in creating a mobile app architecture you endanger the success of your project. The complexity of building high-quality architecture depends on the size of the application. Proper architecture will allow for saving a lot of time, energy, and costs in the future.</span></p>
<h2><b>Mobile App Architecture Diagram</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, having the right architecture means that your mobile application is independent of external resources. All successful projects that are now running on iOS and Android were created by the manual labor of developers and were not subjected to the use of frameworks or similar means. Architecture should not rely on the existence of any library. So you can use frameworks as tools, and not try to drive your system into their limitations. Your mobile application architecture diagram should not be exposed to other operating systems and databases so that it can function regardless of the status of other programs.</span></p>
<h2><b>Mobile App Architecture Example</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good architecture is first and foremost a profitable architecture that makes the process of developing and maintaining a program simpler and more efficient. A program with a good architecture is easier to expand and change, and also to test, debug, and understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the Clean Architecture is a good fit for large scale projects with big budgets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of architecture is universal, allowing for installation of various plug-ins and quick troubleshooting, but it should not be created using frameworks. Program code must be written from scratch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s look at an example of successfully implemented mobile application architecture:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16548" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram.jpg" alt="Mobile App Architecture Diagram" width="599" height="440" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram.jpg 772w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram-300x220.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram-768x564.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram-600x441.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram-450x331.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each layer of such a mobile application is independent of other programs and components, and entitles is a key fragment containing the logic of your application and important objects. All layers are connected by the Dependency Rule, which states that in the source code all dependencies can only be specified internally. For example, nothing from the outer circle can be mentioned by a code from the inner circle. This applies to functions, classes, variables, or any other entity.</span></p>
<h2><b>Android Mobile App Architecture</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, the structure of app development projects looked very simple. Developers did not have any libraries to work with the network, and AsyncTask was still an important component in the creation of Android mobile app architecture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s look at the classic system of creating architecture for Android applications:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16549" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Android-Mobile-App-Architecture.png" alt="Android Mobile App Architecture" width="512" height="263" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Android-Mobile-App-Architecture.png 512w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Android-Mobile-App-Architecture-300x154.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Android-Mobile-App-Architecture-450x231.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s reality, the implementation of Clean Architecture is the best solution for reliable operation. This architecture will allow your application to be independent from frameworks, databases, and more. Transitions between layers in such Android mobile app architecture are carried out through Boundaries, that is, through two interfaces: one for the request, and one for the answer. They are needed so that the inner layer does not depend on the outer layer (following the Dependency Rule), but at the same time it can transmit data to it:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16550" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram.png" alt="Mobile App Architecture Diagram" width="325" height="272" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram.png 394w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram-300x251.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for a dependency in such an Android mobile application architecture to be directed towards the reverse flow of data, the principle of dependency inversion is applied (the letter D from the abbreviation SOLID). That is, instead of Uses Cases being directly dependent on the Presenter (which would violate the Dependency Rule), they depend on the interface in its layer, and the Presenter must implement this interface.</span></p>
<h2><b>iOS Mobile App Architecture</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standard iOS mobile app architecture can be divided into four blocks:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kernel level (Core OS) — works with the file system, controls the validity of various certificates belonging to the applications. Also responsible for the security of the entire system. Contains low-level access to the elements of the device.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Core Services (Core Service) — provides access to databases and file controls.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Media level (Media) — contains tools that allow for processing most media data formats.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interface level (Cocoa Touch) — has many elements for creating mobile interfaces, and also provides the remaining layers with information coming from the user.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A MVC (Massive View Controller) and its prototypes are used to create a high-quality iOS mobile application architecture. Cocoa MVC encourages you to write Massive View Controller, because the controller is so involved in the View life cycle that it is difficult to say that it is a separate entity. Although you still have the opportunity to ship some of the business logic and data conversion in the Model, when it comes to shipping work in View, you have few options:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16551" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/iOS-Mobile-App-Architecture.png" alt="iOS Mobile App Architecture" width="638" height="204" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/iOS-Mobile-App-Architecture.png 800w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/iOS-Mobile-App-Architecture-300x96.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/iOS-Mobile-App-Architecture-768x246.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/iOS-Mobile-App-Architecture-600x192.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/iOS-Mobile-App-Architecture-450x144.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, the entire responsibility of the View is to send actions to the controller. In the end, it all ends with the View Controller becoming a delegating part and a data source, as well as a place to start and cancel server requests.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16552" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Enterprise-Mobile-App-Architecture.png" alt="Enterprise Mobile App Architecture" width="719" height="405" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Enterprise-Mobile-App-Architecture.png 820w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Enterprise-Mobile-App-Architecture-300x169.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Enterprise-Mobile-App-Architecture-768x433.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Enterprise-Mobile-App-Architecture-600x338.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Enterprise-Mobile-App-Architecture-450x254.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" /></p>
<h2><b>Enterprise Mobile App Architecture</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the successful functioning of their businesses, many companies use corporate applications that make it easy for the client and employees to communicate with the company. Inside the application, functions of monitoring, purchases, communication, and filtering services and products from the company are used. For a modern business, one of the priorities is the strategic use of IT technologies and the implementation of business objectives in such a way as to gain a competitive advantage in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, in the enterprise mobile app architecture there is often a discrepancy between the IT infrastructure and business requirements, which is caused by rapid market changes. The problems of the information architecture of business solutions are most often associated with insufficient speed and low scalability, unreliability, as well as the complexity of updating and maintaining software.</span></p>
<h2><b>Mobile Application Architecture Properties</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we know that for high-quality, uninterrupted operation of your mobile application, it is recommended to use the Clean mobile application architecture. When creating a suitable platform for the convenience of your client and employees, you need to follow a few tips that will help ensure your mobile application architecture is of the highest quality. It is important to put together the right technical requirements for the development team so that the experts have a joint goal and working methods.</span></p>
<h2><b>Mobile Application Architecture — Best Practices </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the process of creating a high-quality mobile application architecture, it is necessary to keep the synchronization of all the processes and capabilities of the application. What features really will be in demand in the future application is still a big question. Therefore, to include all ideas in the first version is not the best solution. This will increase the development time, overload the interface and postpone the “combat” product launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we can see the standard model of the data system in the classical mobile enterprise application architecture:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16553" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/mobile-enterprise-application-architecture.jpg" alt="mobile enterprise application architecture" width="722" height="571" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/mobile-enterprise-application-architecture.jpg 722w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/mobile-enterprise-application-architecture-300x237.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/mobile-enterprise-application-architecture-600x475.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/mobile-enterprise-application-architecture-450x356.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" /></p>
<h2><b>Architecture For Mobile Application &amp; Tips For Making It</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A well-designed architecture is needed for all applications, both complex and simple. Using an architecture for mobile application saves time, effort, and costs. A program with a reliable architecture is easier to tweak, test, and debug. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to understand if your application has a good architecture? Here is the checklist:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiency: the application performs the tasks and performs the functions in any conditions. The system is effective, reliable, and copes with all the loads.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility: the chosen solution is easy to change, and errors are few. You can change one element, and it will not be fatal influence the other one in a negative way.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensibility: you can add as many functions as you like to the application.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scalability: time for development and updates decreases. Solid architecture allows you to direct development in several parallel threads.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testability: The architecture for mobile application is easily tested, which means that the number of errors decreases and its reliability increases;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understandability: the code should be understandable to as many developers as possible. A lot of people are working on the application. Good architecture allows beginners to quickly understand the project.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Final Tips For Your Mobile Architecture</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creation of a mobile architecture is a sequential plan that must be completed before the development process begins. This plan provides a map of how the various components of the application should be organized and connected to each other. It presents guidelines that should be followed during the development process and some sacrifices (usually associated with a large number of classes and templates) that will ultimately help you create a well-written application that will be easier to test, expand, and maintain.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s impossible to imagine a company nowadays without a site or a mobile app. Whether you sell products or services, you need a digital platform that will represent your business and tell its story. </p>



<p>If you want to stay ahead of the competition and streamline the customer experience online, your business should keep track of the latest technologies and innovations. A fresh and short way to re-make your online presence in an impactful way, a progressive web app (PWA) is one of the top tech trends in creating engaging customer journeys for this day and age.</p>



<p>As statistics show, businesses that went for progressive web apps accelerated customer growth, page visits, and time users spend on their website, and there’s even more to it. </p>



<p>Sounds great, doesn&#8217;t it? Still, what are these progressive web apps? What advantages and disadvantages do they have? Is it worth to invest money in them in the long run? Let’s find out.</p>



<h2><strong>Progressive Web App Examples</strong> in Detail</h2>



<p>We have explored many PWAs and now want to share with you our selection of progressive web app examples to draw inspiration from in your future efforts. But first, let’s make a brief stop at the basics.</p>



<p><strong>What is a Progressive Web App</strong>? </p>



<p>Progressive web app is a combination of a web page and a mobile application. It’s an app in the form of a site that you don’t need to download to run, but it has all the necessary functions. Simply put, it’s like opening a native app in your browser.</p>



<h2>The <strong>Best Progressive Web Apps</strong> You Can Find Today</h2>



<p>You might have seen and even used these progressive web app examples on a daily basis, but have no idea they are PWAs under the hood. From ordering a taxi to games to journalism, here are some of the most popular and engaging prograssive web apps out there. </p>



<h2><strong>Progressive Web App Example</strong> Selection #1 — Services</h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><a href="https://m.uber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Uber</a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eeAatzS7ZMDNUGM3m0_EsHx2Ri7PqDM86uiHf7gosKLg0OLNKslEH9__MEuPuV5phLS9hh4IJieFZDsJOp7RcJ-quiY5TS_om_pyVDpc5CnHwDgrq9NiI2g3kMTuvJeVQwy-EI9NkRUWw5457g" alt="Progressive Web App Example" /></figure>



<p>Did you know that now you are able to order a car without installing the native Uber app? The company is keen on continuously improving their web and mobile presence, so it’s essential that they also have launched a lighter version of their native mobile app. Now, a user that needs to call an Uber, but can’t or don’t want to use the app, have a quick accessible option. Another plus is that progressive web apps can work on medium network connection on any device. So, if a user does not have a fresh smartphone device or operating system, this version provides an excellent alternative. </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><a href="https://m.ru.aliexpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">AliExpress</a></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dZjG-iJMs4U8iy2_aZa0M2GyL82bEdgvWRpRon0dkS-6Egq1mC_B4_MM_KBSh3VTVovpxrwiOyFZDJR1IA7GSgsCkH2pjK6mYdTuEJLHjQjELvC4Jitx17eDJ9b5E9wh0aBT2EFA4e8u87Zsg" alt="Progressive Web Apps" /></figure>



<p>AliExpress has an even bigger audience than Uber, so they need to ensure a serviceable experience on as many devices as possible. The standard web version had it all for customers to make purchases, manage their orders, make payments, and make other common actions. Once the website was turned into a PWA, the number of users increased hundredfold, the number of visited pages per session doubled, and users have started to spend more time on the site. A truly solid progressive web app example from China’s ecommerce giant.</p>



<h2><strong>Examples of Progressive Web Apps</strong>: Social Media &amp; Entertainment</h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DLbjB3hJWdQLtQob1sV1yFKMoLXrDpy3UebHv2Yk5ijy-a9yYfxVP9SuZsR-WY0QtqIjcS77OOEekVfYqMJZDjwIveGRI1qIqn8SgcdL6TZ3iEsupqSWF0XH6IcS4g-E8g6ohYX9EgIJCWU-qA" alt="Progressive Web Apps" width="376" height="669" /></figure>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers of this app have made it possible to log in to your account from any browser. In earlier versions, you could only access the timeline, but now you may add pictures from any device and even view stories. Some functions lack in the PWA version of Instagram (you will not be able to see what posts you’ve liked, for example), but that does not affect the core experience, especially if it’s not your go-to social network.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Pinterest </a></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jciJhFDGRNg6khHwKbBCGe1I8RRK75w3I4HXNt2K2yjJNxtC__YCLWwxo6MMkVTHuHwQ74XAD_Hi0Sr7S3ufx21qHImz98S6hCGQkp1HFJTe-2pX9K6FLWEiXtUF3G2zFIc-FMEDIyOHUlfeIg" alt="Progressive Web Apps" /></figure>



<p>The PWA version of Pinterest is a result of a poor transfer of browser users to the native application, and it turned out to be a perfect solution. One of the progressive web apps that have contributed to revenue growth, better user engagement, and increased the time visitors spend on the website, this version of Pinterest is a happy medium for the company and its users.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Twitter Lite</a></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YCEsyoGW4ApXnUebpE546rMOzGDOWqtdPuRGSTF6AGlIcshM0hT3UJAMRtb9UsShB0PgaM2Adqy9Pg75aE5TCsmesmf-QFK-PjRmso8ElR8r-mJEHcyNeDEb74NMnTbe9Mwwl4Q2iKqTCHW6pw" alt="progressive web apps examples" /></figure>



<p>This version of Twitter allows you to send tweets even from the most isolated and remote parts of our planet. This proggressive web app is extremely light and small, so can run it on any device without downloading anything.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.forbes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Forbes</a></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YAwUtGK0KtZ5c9geA4vQ4o9gMRZ89OE44TwuVGTNejAq4Y4C_yvCzpHEzkFc8MD0QoXWoMs556nPUhfQ6DPzWto3K_59e2YEHFhfOODWhJNVd7uxDjJeEi1eEel0KQFLs-Ti3FBpIg_7SP6EvA" alt="what is a progressive web app" /></figure>



<p>Example progressive web app for a top magazine? Easy. The Forbes website is a PWA that has helped the popular publication increase its article completion rate sixfold. The new architecture also helped increase the average time spent on the page. Now, every Forbes.com visitors can enjoy news across industries and markets on any device and when cellular connection is not that high.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><a href="https://wiki-offline.jakearchibald.com/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Wikipedia </a></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/r0Zo1opQLJWNf6DqzSmWfUdl5vrnbHNoRVNK8zT1xSwgE2xxSOyS0_ie8skUc52pqJAVsq8Ef0hfqCBx7V6GyRjjpX51iKdSCgtep8GFtkURwXmBZ9obUzHgJajhpLTVbru_I4QrTPYF9IFGyA" alt="example progressive web app" /></figure>



<p>One of the prominent features of a PWA is that it updates itself. Wikipedia’s progressive web app can be accessed offline, and when you connect to the Internet next time, the page will be updated (if someone made changes to it during the time, of course).</p>



<h2><a href="https://tinder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Tinder</a></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2EBYiitnIej47pN0ndPFj5AgM7hKDpsjkXYdX-rrIPJLxRLe4_Hs6XNRW0i89Hz-Y-tU5axA4lUt-goPo2KoRRevLqdnmLdZqJcU5IQZVjoQ66obqfN2d_1hiyDb8NuwNXwRQEdWV7M2K2Z0cw" alt="examples of progressive web apps" /></figure>



<p>Although tailor-made for mobile, Tinder’s progressive web app example is a masterclass in the field. Simple, easy-to-use, and with two modes of operation (keyboard and touchpad), Tinder’s PWA successfully transfers the experience from the mobile app to desktop.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><a href="https://web.telegram.org/#/login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Telegram</a></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rCWxY3vcmYlwzH3q610yzfcYU9Z7s4-lzYDJGJxXgWdzi--oUdhCH-gaioOv_tGuuOqPB9B0oHFSBvzMbojqfSWchVYXrYmYtZMh37tNCVC9qIU3W5XiY5hxADWJaHFTJoQqLhlW3Gn4dNMRHQ" alt="progressive web apps pros and cons" /></figure>



<p>Telegram is one of the most utilized chat platforms available today. The app might fulfill all your needs, but the PWA version is a pleasant extension for those who prefer shifting from small screens to big comfortable keyboards for a change. Getting started is as easy as everything about Telegram, and you can also manage alerts if you need to.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">The Guardian</a></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As media outlets try to retain and grow their reader base, re-making the standard website into a progressive web app is one of the options. The Guardian is one the publications that made the transition. Many people read news during the commute, and The Guardian made sure to make the experience as pleasant and consistent as possible. </p>



<h2><a href="https://play2048.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">2048</a></h2>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some music apps are so well-made that you forget you can access them outside your smartphone. More so, versions on other platforms are not always as good. Spotify’s PWA is not the case. Here, the company was able to transfer the experience successfully: it’s familiar and it’s comfortable. If you were ever to use this version, you’ll enjoy Spotify as you usually do.</p>



<h2><strong>Progressive Web Apps Features</strong> that Make the Difference</h2>



<p>While native apps should be loaded on your phone and web pages manage to function properly only when you have an Internet connection, the above-mentioned examples of progressive web apps show that a happy medium is reachable.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at what makes these applications “progressive:” </p>



<ul>
<li>Progressive web app can function <em>offline</em> (some content is visible even if the gadget is disconnected from the network) or with a <em>low-quality</em>  W3 connection</li>
<li>By nature, a PWA architecture is sophisticated and <em>fits every browser or device</em></li>
<li>PWA has an <em>application-like interface</em></li>
<li>User doesn’t need to <em>install anything on their device</em></li>
<li><em>push-notifications</em> are possible in the same way as they work in mobile apps</li>
<li>PWA is <em>light on size </em>and <em>works fast</em></li>
<li>Once connected to the Internet, the PWA <em>self-updates</em></li>
<li>everyone can <em>find a progressive web app using a search engine</em> or access it <em>via shared URL</em>, there’s no need in visiting any app stores.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qYU7BGYg1ogEk2mN5YWrmNcqSnHt4-VTm_qfqy8uUnmWGbT7kdA0shT98IqXNQFaszRm8VSWPZU5zoh3kXbXqwkg5svE39mEHeU_l-tw8FTVaXCx0T555vcTZAXdd8Ib7tJwpCdSWNYj8W4tMA" alt="progressive web apps features" /></figure>



<p>A progressive web app is a perfect combination of traits that have changed the look of ordinary sites and that can be used on a higher number of devices across the globe. Both companies and web developers now have an outstanding alternative. Examples of progressive web apps shown above solidify that status.</p>



<h2><strong>Progressive Web Apps Pros and Cons</strong>: Evaluation</h2>



<p>As it can be seen from the aforementioned progressive web apps examples, there are some remarkable features and qualities of these applications that can be taken into account while you mull it over whether to invest in a PWA for your business or not. </p>



<p><strong>Pros of PWAs: </strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Progressive web apps help increase the number of users and revenues as well as make the user experience more comfortable</li>
<li>The PWAs cost less than regular mobile apps and can be created quicker</li>
<li>PWAs incorporate the majority of usual benefits of a native mobile app</li>
<li>Can work offline or with poor network connection, so you can expand your business or service to developing countries who only start to use 3G and where users don’t buy new smartphones often.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons of PWAs: </strong></p>



<ul>
<li>PWAs cannot be downloaded from platforms like Google Play or App Store (apart from Twitter Lite). For instance, you wouldn’t be able to find feedback on a PWA as quickly.</li>
<li>Users cannot get the full experience, miss out on key features.</li>
<li>Progressive web apps are not ubiquitous yet, there hardware and software limitations despite the fact that PWA can work or older smartphones. Still, this is not a major downside.</li>
<li>PWA consume more battery life than standard websites.</li>
</ul>



<p>The advantages of progressive web apps outweigh the downsides of this architecture. First, consider all the pros and cons with your project in mind. Then, it is better to test several apps and discover the difference yourself. Overall, progressive web app examples prove that digital-based services can be delivered to customers in an easier and more sophisticated way. This is an app type that saves a lot of time as it doesn’t require downloading and installation — users can visit a website, log in and start using/buying your services/products. </p>



<p>In case you still have doubts, consult with developers and consider whether you really need a PWA. The modern world is constantly changing and it is better track interesting developments and innovation — there’s always something useful and cost-efficient your users will enjoy. A progressive web app might just be what you need. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Before diving deep on enterprise mobile application development, most people find themselves confused. The term sounds vague and general, appearing in similarly general descriptions of solutions for SMBs that improve business processes.</p>



<p>One of the ways to get a proper grasp of the topic requires exploring neighbouring concepts — mobile enterprise application development and enterprise mobile app development strategy.</p>



<p>This way, we will find what it really is and what software exactly an enterprise mobile app development company creates for its clients.</p>



<h2><strong>Enterprise Mobile Application Development Basics</strong><strong>?</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s start with the basics.</p>



<p>An enterprise application is a software solution created for managing common organizational issues in a company. In other words, it solves a particular problem in enterprise infrastructure or process by means of digital technology.</p>



<p>Therefore, the aim of enterprise mobile application development is to analyse the existing issue in the company and create an application that will solve it in an efficient and user-friendly way.</p>



<p>Enterprise app development consists of a succession of stages that move teams towards this goal. They include product design, elaboration, actualization, and deployment.     </p>



<h2><strong>Why </strong><strong>Enterprise Mobile Applications Development Strategy</strong><strong> Is Key?</strong></h2>



<p>A short answer — there is a wide array of approaches, and you should select the one that fits your needs and business objectives.  </p>



<p>As for the specifics of mobile application enterprise development, many companies emphasize the importance of crafting a user-friendly, cost-effective, and interactive app. These features require a high level of effort, research, and communication with the client prior to the development process itself. This is the stage when you need to use strategic thinking.</p>



<p>While choosing a partner for this stage, there are two critical factors you need to consider. First, the ability to adopt various methodologies and expertise in implementation of the latest  technologies. Second, and even more important, is the way an enterprise mobile application company connects its knowledge and experience in those two areas when creating a solution for you company. While discussing these factors and exploring corresponding projects a company has finished, you will have a chance to understand how well does a company perform strategic planning.</p>



<p>Here are other some other factors that you should consider:</p>



<ul>
<li>How the company solves overarching enterprise-level issues, not the issues of different  departments separately</li>
<li>An ability to convert all client ideas into workable solutions</li>
<li>Clear delivery at every step of the process</li>
<li>Approaching the solution with an understanding that the processes involved in it need to be streamlined and unified</li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Main </strong><strong>Enterprise Mobile Development Platforms</strong></h2>



<p>As the main platforms on the digital market, iOS and Android are two foundations for enterprise mobile app development. In this context, the business need in question may call for designing a native app or adopting a cross-platform approach.</p>



<p>Besides, mobile application enterprise development involves establishing your solution on one of the cloud platforms (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure). In 2019, running at least some operations in cloud is the default state for the vast majority of enterprises.</p>



<p>So, here is every enterprise mobile app development platform that might be involved in the development of your solution</p>



<ul>
<li>Android</li>
<li>iOS</li>
<li>Cross-platform approach</li>
<li>Cloud technology</li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Basic </strong><strong>Enterprise Mobile Application Development Tools</strong></h2>



<p>Among the basic tools that assist in crafting a mobile application, enterprise development mostly uses the tools of the cross-platform approach. With it, the client’s solution gets as much coverage as possible.</p>



<p>Here are the basic tools involved in the process: Adobe applications (especially the PhotoGap Build cloud technology); Xamarin (that guarantees convenient testing and access to cloud); Appcelerator (due to its JavaScript and analytics advantages); iFactr (for high-speed solutions); Kony (as a tool for the whole software development life cycle); SAP (one of the oldest and the most reliable tools); Alpha (specific enterprise-oriented tool). Still, not all of these are used at the same time and in every project. Usually, the list encompasses the following tools:</p>



<ul>
<li>Xamarin (uses C# code);</li>
<li>SAP (employs HTML5 code);</li>
<li>Kony (good for creating widgets, uses JavaScript);</li>
<li>Alpha (for development of fast business apps, adopts both JavaScript and HTML5).</li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Enterprise Mobile Apps Examples</strong><strong>  </strong></h2>



<p>Among the various ways to perform enterprise mobile app development, the industry-focused approach is the most efficient. This way, you get a solution that is tailored not only to your company and operations, but also the industry you operate in.</p>



<p>Here’s the shortlist of industries that rely on enterprise mobile app development the most:</p>



<ul>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>Healthcare</li>
<li>Manufacturing</li>
<li>Communications</li>
<li>Retail</li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Enterprise Mobile App Development Challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Enterprise mobile app development can solve an immense number of issues for any company and in any industry.</p>



<p>This includes enhancing the efficiency of the client’s teams. Software development experts should craft a user experience that will be comfortable for people working on these teams as well as carefully consider the workflow. To succeed in it, the experts on a software development team do a comprehensive research and, after the development is over, train the client’s employees on how to use the solution.</p>



<p>A software development company should also carefully approach the ideation of product architecture. Choosing the wrong way to build a solution may lead to massive budget loses. For example, hybrid enterprise app could have been the best option for the client given their challenges, proposed functionality, and budget limitations, but the software development company proposed two native apps instead.</p>



<p>While creating a mobile application, enterprise development teams should also pay attention to solving security risks. The client’s sensitive data should be guarded by means like cryptography to prevent any malevolent actors from tampering with it.</p>



<p>Another crucial challenge for enterprise mobile developers is guaranteeing pleasant and easy user experience. To deal with this aspect, UI and UX designers enter the stage, their task being to craft the most beautiful and efficient solution for the given business need. In this department, small app size and high speed are always top priority.</p>



<h2><strong>Best Practices For Enterprise Mobile App Development</strong></h2>



<p>Broadly speaking, enterprise mobile application development can be compared to an art. So, it should have its own amateurs and masters. In this context, the team’s composition is important – thus, the expertise of each member and the synergy of their combined effort as well.</p>



<p>As Intellectsoft has gained a reputation as a reliable partner in mobile enterprise application development, and to provide a first-row perspective, we will be exploring our own projects as examples of enterprise app development.</p>



<p>From digital transformation with mobile to top-of-the-line content tools for the finance industry, here are three cases that showcase Intellectsoft as an enterprise mobile application development company.  </p>



<h3><strong>Case Study #1: EuroAccident</strong></h3>



<p>For the EuroAccident project, Intellectsoft aimed at improving the bond between this Swedish insurance firm and its clients and key stakeholders.</p>



<p>Intellectsoft created a cloud-based mobile solution that addressed the new challenges and seamlessly integrated into the existing infrastructure of EuroAccident. The solution delivered a new type of user experience to the company’s clients, giving them a useful mobile application that helps on most stages of the insurance process. Features included digital documentation management, spot-on doctor booking services, appointment scheduling, integration with the most popular banking account authorization system, and many more.</p>



<h3><strong>Case Study #2: Top Oil &amp; Gas Company</strong></h3>



<p>For this project, we created a mobile solution that helps the employees, visitors, and trainees of  the company&#8217;s vast training center manage their day-to-day activities. The solution converges all the training-related information in one place, allowing all participants to focus more on the educational process. The app’s notifications always keep trainees informed on upcoming lectures or important announcements, while the interactive map ensure no visitor or newcomer is lost on the campus grounds.</p>



<h3><strong>Case Study #3: EY</strong></h3>



<p>Our software development team managed to address EY’s need for a comprehensive mobile platform for providing expert opinion on taxes, assurance, and consulting<em>.</em> Being highly sophisticated and narrow-oriented, the content composition appeared as a challenge for Intellectsoft, calling for designing a highly spot-on and user-friendly UX.</p>



<p>The resulting solution, titled Forecasts in Focus, proved a reliable backbone for high-quality content creation and distribution. Features included an easy-to-use interface for EY’s editors that allowed them to engage the audience in an effective and timely way, and an eye-pleasing and customisable feed for the users. The digital solution helped Ernst &amp; Young strengthen its brand and reputation as a top financial exper.</p>



<h2><strong>Trends In </strong><strong>Mobile Enterprise Application Development</strong></h2>



<p>Among the key trends in enterprise mobile app development, observers acknowledge the increased demand in mobile applications that will have a very strong impact on the market. According to Statista, in a couple of years, the number of mobile apps downloads will reach almost 260 billion. So, any enterprise should consider performing mobile transformation as a part of the overarching Digital Transformation strategy.</p>



<p>Furthermore, some fresh forces are likely to determine the market trends in the near future. Among them are hybrid cloud, Big Data, blockchain, and DevOps.</p>



<p>But what these trends actually mean for enterprise mobile app development? Big Data, for one thing, promises wider perspectives of managing and leveraging business intelligence, especially if machine learning algorithms are involved. Blockchain, in its turn, innovates enterprise transactions while elevating security.</p>



<p>Therefore, the whole area of enterprise mobile application development is in constant transformation, reacting to the many digital innovations every year.  </p>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts on </strong><strong>Enterprise Mobile Applications Development</strong></h2>



<p>Although a vague term at first glance, enterprise mobile app development uses the many possibilities of mobile technology to address challenges in different enterprise operations, areas, and departments. By addressing all the recent trends on the digital market, constantly widening the list of available tools and platforms, and putting out more and more industry-specific solutions, this type of software development can help the Enterprise reach new highs.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want to build a business online, you’ll want to locate it where your customers are. You’ve heard about traditional mediums like blogs, forums, catalogs, social media platforms and maybe you even have an app for your company’s services. The important factors to consider are how much attention your customers pay to the sources and how much time they spend on each platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbots_user_retention.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13968" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbots_user_retention.png" alt="User retention for chat bots" width="740" height="590" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbots_user_retention.png 1200w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbots_user_retention-300x239.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbots_user_retention-768x612.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbots_user_retention-1024x817.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbots_user_retention-600x479.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbots_user_retention-450x359.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/chatbots_user_retention-1000x798.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></a></p>
<p>In early 2015 we saw a new instrument caught the market’s attention – chatbots. And while business messenger Slack dominated the chatbot revolution, everybody was waiting for Zuckerberg’s Facebook to show up with their chatbot platform. So we’ve been waiting patiently and the miracle finally happened at F8 conference triggering the chatbot boom, which is still continuing today.</p>
<p>Now you may wonder when this craze is going to die down. It&#8217;s hard to say, but what we know so far is that they&#8217;re here to stay and they&#8217;re going to keep on revolutionizing.</p>
<p>But wait, Bogdan, what’s the big deal about chatbots and why is everybody talking about them?! It&#8217;s all about capturing user attention, which nowadays is focused heavily on messenger apps. Furthermore, bots are using Natural Language Processing algorithms and AI layer to communicate with you, messaging apps are the best place for them to live. Let’s try to figure out why.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re a media company like The Wall Street Journal, Business Insider or CNN. You’re making revenue by selling advertising and publishing sponsored content, while your main expenses are creating and distributing content. So let’s think a bit about distribution.</p>
<blockquote><p>The open rate for mobile messages is a near perfect 98 percent, which is exponentially higher than the 22 percent rate emails employ.</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: left;">Soon we&#8217;ll start seeing chatbots everywhere. You can start interacting with a chatbot by sending a message. <a href="https://m.me/CNN">Try it with CNN chatbot</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s look at a different scenario &#8211; you’re one of Facebook’s chatbot partners <a href="https://www.1800flowers.com">1-800-Flowers.com</a> and you basically need to sell flowers online. You have a number of phone and chat support staff, helping you to take care of most of the routine work part of which can be automated with chatbots (powered by self-learning AI component).</p>
<p class="upgrades" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Have a question about building a conversational bot for your business?</strong> We&#8217;ve already made successful bots for media companies and e-commerce businesses. Let’s move forward with your project. <a href="https://stanfy.com/get-in-touch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lets talk.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are over 10,000 in Taobao and over 100,000 small merchants in TMall, two of the largest e-Commerce websites in China. Most of them have less than 10 people working for a company, but they’re obligated to hire an extra person just for answering online enquiries from customers. That’s the exact pain point chatbots are aiming to solve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">Alex Cheung, Founder &amp; CEO @ <a href="https://kami.ai/">Kami.AI</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">We see a huge potential in customer service where you answer frequently asked questions in an automated way that I think is a cost gain so companies will need fewer agents, fewer customer service agents who are typing the very same answers to everybody.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">Ákos Deliága, CEO &amp; Co-founder @ <a href="http://talkabot.net/">Talk-A-Bot</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the first two months after introducing its Facebook chatbot, 1-800-Flowers.com reported that more than 70 percent of its Messenger orders were from new customers. These new customers were also generally younger than the company’s typical shopper, as they were already familiar with the Facebook Messenger app.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Chatbots Aren’t Just Built For Millennials</h2>
<p>Data from Business Insider shows us that chatbots are pretty popular amongst users from 18 to 55 years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bii-chatbotsusers.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13971" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bii-chatbotsusers.png" alt="US Chat bot usage among Millennials and Get Xers" width="740" height="590" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bii-chatbotsusers.png 960w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bii-chatbotsusers-300x239.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bii-chatbotsusers-768x613.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bii-chatbotsusers-600x479.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/bii-chatbotsusers-450x359.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></a></p>
<h2>How Exactly Are Chatbots Going To Make Money</h2>
<p>With payments integrated directly into the chatbot, you can use it in retail, consulting, hotel reservations and many more. Here’s a list of business models that would benefit from the application of chatbots.</p>
<h3>Pure retail sales bots</h3>
<p>Retail is one of the most straightforward experiences you will find amongst chatbots. You can imagine stores like Wal-Mart, Harry’s, Target and Amazon creating bots where people can ask them if they sell something like “Shampoo” or “Hammer” and the bot responds with prices and a “Buy now” button. Take Amazon’s Alexa for example: right now you can ask Alexa to re-order the goods you bought last week on Amazon! The user will make the purchase directly through a chat with the bot and it will act in a similar way to a transaction from a typical website, but it will be done in the palm of their hand.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are able to learn quickly from the orders history, so we can turn the bot into a productivity bot. Based on the individual user shopping habits the bot is able to predict what the user would buy, so the cart will already be prefilled with products the bot will pick.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">Cloderic Mars, CTO @ <a href="http://www.craft.ai/">craft.ai</a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Bots + sponsored &amp; native content</h3>
<p>Native content and advertising is a trend that has been soaring over the past few years thanks to the likes of BuzzFeed, VICE, Huffington Post, Business Insider and more. Native or Sponsored content is a model in which brands pay to have their content distributed by media companies directly into their channels in a way that is often viewed as content created by the media outlet rather than a brand.</p>
<p>Now imagine you’re using a Cooking Bot. While the bot will tell you that swapping Cumin for Coriander is okay in a certain recipe through its native function , it will also send you an article that talks about “5 Exotic Meat Recipes That Will Please Your Guests.”</p>
<h3>Bots for research</h3>
<p>Wondering what millennials are thinking about the Presidential Election?</p>
<p>There are bots that you can pay to do the research for you. Bots like <a href="https://botlist.co/bots/639-disordatbot">DisOrDatBot</a> are already asking people simple this or that questions, as you can see in the example above.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_13972" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13972" style="width: 485px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-13972" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/DisorDatBot-research-poll-chat-bot.png" alt="DisorDatBot research poll chat bot" width="485" height="289" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/DisorDatBot-research-poll-chat-bot.png 485w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/DisorDatBot-research-poll-chat-bot-300x179.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/DisorDatBot-research-poll-chat-bot-450x268.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-13972" class="wp-caption-text">DisorDatBot chat bot interface</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Now, imagine you’re an event planner and are trying to determine which music act you should try to book for your city. Rather than using an expensive research firm or inaccurate focus group, you can run a research campaign with DisOrDatBot and ask users in your city whether they prefer Radiohead or Nickelback.</p>
<h3>Bots for lead generation</h3>
<p>Lead generation businesses are like the Wild West of the online world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a landing page.</li>
<li>Acquire targeted leads.</li>
<li>Sell leads to producers.</li>
<li>Profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the near future we will see chatbots that act as lead generation businesses with an initial focus on content. The chatbots will deliver insights and information to users who are looking for advice about home ownership, insurance, weddings or finances and then pass along user information to various businesses who sell services and products that line up with the content they’re delivering.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you’re talking to the “Shopping Bot” and start engaging in a conversation about home buying. As the discussion continues, the bot gathers information like the amount of cash you have for a down payment, where you want to live, whether you’re employed and whether it’s your first home. After building this relationship, the bot asks you:</p>
<blockquote><p>Could I pass this along to someone to get in touch?</p></blockquote>
<p>You agree and the bot then passes your information along to a Real Estate company in your area. The Real Estate company follows up with you the next day and the bot company gets paid for the lead.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the greatest added values of chatbots is using them for generating prospects. You can reach your potential clients directly where their attention is (messengers) and present them your newest products, services or goods. When a customer would like to purchase a product/service, he/she can make the purchase within the chatbot, including the payment process. Bots, like 1-800flowers.com, eBay, Fynd have already proved that.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">Julien Blancher, Co-Founder @ <a href="https://recast.ai/">Recast.AI</a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s the updated lead generation process, but using a bot:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Company Creates Lead Generation Bot.</li>
<li>Bot Validates The Lead.</li>
<li>Lead Passed To Company.</li>
<li>Commision Paid By Company To Bot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cost per conversation/task</h3>
<p>People want advice and are always willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>As bots become more sophisticated, I expect people will be willing to pay to have conversations with the bots that can help them with miscellaneous challenges in life. For example, you could talk to the “Oprah Bot” if you needed life advice, the “Mechanic Bot” for information on your car or the “Marriage Bot” if you wanted anonymous marriage counseling.</p>
<p>Marriage counselors can charge anywhere from $75 to $200 or more per hour depending on where you live, the experience of the therapist, and the type of setting.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is just the beginning. What we’ve looked at is just a snapshot of a technology which is capable of changing not only small businesses, but also major industries into slick, effective mechanisms. Artificial intelligence will become smarter, the response of natural language processing will become faster and many processes will become much easier, like arguing with Comcast for example. Just kidding.</p>
