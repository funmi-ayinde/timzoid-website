<p><img class="size-full wp-image-17980 aligncenter" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SaaS-Project-Management.jpg" alt="SaaS Project Management" width="452" height="279" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SaaS-Project-Management.jpg 452w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SaaS-Project-Management-300x185.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SaaS-Project-Management-450x278.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></p>
<h2>SaaS Development: Main Reasons to Choose for Outsourcing</h2>
<p>SaaS product development has emerged thanks to the rise of Cloud storages thus giving numerous opportunities to the businesses that wish to provide their services online. The secret of success and popularity lies in SaaS development life cycle, team structure, and applied tools that allow creating apps with a number of great and useful features.</p>
<p>SaaS software development is applied in different fields, including office and messaging software, accounting, invoicing, CRM (customer relationship manager), ERP (enterprise resource management), HRM (human resource management), payroll processing software, management software, service desk management, etc. It can be quite a benefit for the companies, facilitating inner communication or other important processes by reducing the time and costs.</p>
<p>Apart from its application possibilities, SaaS outsourcing help companies save costs, are perfect for communication, file and data sharing, facilitate managerial responsibilities, as well as help to complete projects faster and quickly find the right people to complete certain tasks. Let’s discuss all of these aspects in more detail.</p>
<h2>What is SaaS Development? The Meaning Behind Abbreviation</h2>
<p>So, what is SaaS development? What is the meaning that we can understand from the abbreviation?</p>
<p>SaaS (Service as a Software) is cloud-based software distribution. It’s a delivery model that’s available by the third-party over the internet. There is no need to install software on your computer, you just have to log in into your account. SaaS software is offered usually on a monthly subscription basis for companies. As the SaaS applications are cloud-based, everyone can have access to them via any device. The only thing you need is an internet connection. This perfectly works for the companies, as your staff will also have personalized access to the software.</p>
<p>Here is the first advantage of SaaS outsourcing, there is no need to recruit IT specialists to install the needed software on every computer in the office. Being cloud-based has its advantages, as you have immediate access to the applications, can work with them from any device, provide access to all your staff without any fuss. You don’t have to worry about the updates, as the third-party providing SaaS software will be in charge of it.</p>
<h2>Why Outsourcing SaaS Development Company is a Good Idea for Your Business?</h2>
<p>The answer is quite simple &#8211; it takes off you a lot of extra duties, as SaaS development providers will be in charge of the software and will provide you with all the essential resources to complete the project in you have in mind.</p>
<p>Why outsourcing may be the best idea? We will discuss all the aspects, but for now, it’s important to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>it lowers costs for the project;</li>
<li>there is no need to recruit new team members;</li>
<li>it makes timeframes shorter to complete the projects and launch the product;</li>
<li>it will help you quickly meet market demands.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the key reasons to cooperate with professional, experienced and established SaaS platforms. You save your time, you don’t have to spend months searching for the right candidates, you can complete app development faster. Apart from this, you will be able to launch the product quickly and take your place on the market.</p>
<h3>SaaS Product Development Strategy: Things to Keep in Mind</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17981 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SaaS-Product-Development-Strategy.jpg" alt="SaaS Product Development Strategy" width="452" height="345" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SaaS-Product-Development-Strategy.jpg 452w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SaaS-Product-Development-Strategy-300x229.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/SaaS-Product-Development-Strategy-450x343.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></p>
<p>When starting the project, you should have a strategy. In case you find it difficult or you lack knowledge in some aspects of the process, you can outsource the team to take care of it. Still, there are important things to remember when working on SaaS app.</p>
<p>SaaS application should bring some value to the customers. In other words, your target audience should see a need in using your product. The application should have functional tools, account management, analytics, user-centred design. Outline the main purpose of your app, state the basic functions, and gradually add more advanced ones. This strategy has proven to work best for SaaS apps.</p>
<h3>Team Structure In SaaS Development</h3>
<p>Quite often we lack the human resources within our company to develop a perfect product that will be constantly maintained and updated in accordance with the latest changes. This is another reason for you to consider outsourcing SaaS team rather than setting your own one, as you can delay the product launch for months.</p>
<p>In any case, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project manager;</li>
<li>Cloud solution architect;</li>
<li>Back-end developers;</li>
<li>Front-end developers;</li>
<li>UI/UX designers;</li>
<li>QAs;</li>
<li>DevOps specialists;</li>
<li>Administrators.</li>
</ul>
<p>Team arrangement won’t be hard if you know your needs, estimate timeframes and budget, decide on the complexity of the app, choose the appropriate technology stack, but it definitely is time-consuming and requires to do extra work.</p>
<h3>Life Cycle In SaaS</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17982 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Life-Cycle-In-SaaS.jpg" alt="Life Cycle In SaaS" width="452" height="300" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Life-Cycle-In-SaaS.jpg 452w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Life-Cycle-In-SaaS-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Life-Cycle-In-SaaS-450x299.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></p>
<p>If you are interested in building and marketing the app in the most successful and efficient way, you should know the SaaS product development life cycle. There are the following phases that can ensure constant delivery and excellent product implementation:</p>
<p><strong>1. Envision </strong></p>
<p>No successful product creation and implementation are possible without a detailed business plan. Think of the opportunities provided by the cloud services and specify what you want to deliver to your customer. Always think ahead by taking into account both technical development strategy and marketing one, so you know where to find new customers or business opportunities before the product is developed and available.</p>
<p><strong>2. Evaluate the Platform</strong></p>
<p>Choose wisely SaaS application framing platform, as it should have all the necessary tools to complete the project. The task at this phase is to determine whether it’s possible to successfully implement required features on the chosen platform.</p>
<p><strong> 3. Plan </strong></p>
<p>During this phase of product creation, you should analyse all the project requirements and create technical specifications for developers.</p>
<p><strong>4. Choose Subscription Model </strong></p>
<p>Here you finalize all the decisions relevant to cost and architecture, as well as think of the proper backup and disaster recovery plans.</p>
<p><strong>5. Develop</strong></p>
<p>The name of the phase says it all. During this one, the core features are built and scalable software architecture is created. This phase will also involve testing in order to evaluate the performance.</p>
<p><strong>6. Operate </strong></p>
<p>Once the service is deployed, you should provide constant application updates and security checks in order to keep up with clients expectations.</p>
<p>You need a well-prepared team to easily move from one phase to another and complete the project. So, it will be easier to outsource the SaaS platform, rather than starting from scratch.</p>
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<p>Saas development is not an easy task, so considering outsourcing might be the right option. But still, you have to know the main steps that should be undertaken in order to develop an app that will meet market demands.</p>
<p><em>Identify the concept:</em> the only thing that works best for the new businesses nowadays is uniqueness. You should find the field that is not occupied and is not well-developed yet, where you can start and reach the top position.</p>
<p><em>Think of SaaS functionality</em>: features of the app should correspond to the client’s needs.</p>
<p><em>Technical stack</em>: choose the best tools that will help you present the main features of the app.</p>
<p><em>Determine the budget</em>: outline the costs by taking into account the tools you use, specialists to work on your project, planned features.</p>
<p><em>MVP (minimum viable product)</em>: the app should be able to easily deliver the product and target the right audience. <em> </em></p>
<p><em>Improvements</em>: SaaS app is convenient for both the company and its users, as it is easy to maintain and upgrade on a constant basis.</p>
<h3>Tools For SaaS Development That Make Products Great</h3>
<p>SaaS software development requires the latest and most efficient tools to create efficient products that will keep up with the fast-growing and changing technological world.  When choosing a platform, you should take into account different aspects to find the best solution for your ideas and be able to deliver the product you want to.</p>
<p>We have chosen the most popular tools that can help you with various technical aspects of your product creation.</p>
<p><em>Server-Side:</em></p>
<p>Being identical to server-side technologies for web development, you should choose the tools based on customization, easiness in use, documentation, and community support. The tools that share these characteristics include RoR, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Java, Python.</p>
<p><em>Front-End:</em></p>
<p>One of the best frameworks is JavaScript, but apart from it, you can use Angular, Vue.js, React.</p>
<p><em>Providers: </em></p>
<p>It is not an easy way to build platforms for cloud management, it is expensive in terms of costs and workforce. There are such cloud platforms as Azure, Heroku, Google Cloud, AWS that provide the necessary software, DevOps tools, and hardware.</p>
<p><em>Database Management: </em></p>
<p>MongoDB and MySQL are among the best sources for database management.</p>
<p><em>Analytics: </em></p>
<p>Analytics matters in every business field. Talking about SaaS you can use Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Baremetrics, that have proven to be the most suitable and effective ones.</p>
<h3>SaaS Development Costs</h3>
<p>In comparison with the traditional software installation for the enterprise, SaaS costs are lower, as providers offer month subscription fee based on usage parameters, for example, the number of app users.</p>
<p>Providers usually offer a price that is competitive with the on-premise software. Thanks to SaaS services there is no need to buy expensive software or hardware to support it. It allows companies to have predictable budgeting, as well as to terminate SaaS offerings to stop spending costs on unnecessary things.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>SaaS development outsourcing has great advantages that we have discussed. Although there are some cons (like lack of control, connectivity requirement, slower performance, a limited number of applications, etc.), still it is a popular way to provide services, make revenue, and facilitate some aspects of work within the company. To put it concisely, the key advantages of outsourcing SaaS development include:</p>
<ul>
<li>lower costs;</li>
<li>quick set up;</li>
<li>constant upgrades;</li>
<li>easy access;</li>
<li>scalability.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above information will help you make up your made and choose the best for your business.</p>

<p>That is why in this article, we are going to shed light on ten tips to organize an effective working process with remote developers, taking into account both psychological pitfalls and practical hurdles to overcome.</p>
<h2><b>How to Manage a Team of Remote Developers Despite the Uncertainty</b></h2>
<p>First and foremost, you need to outline all the possible challenges your software development team may face when working from home. Usually, it boils down to three main challenges. These are communication problems and pitfalls, lack of well-functioned equipment, and the inability to manage productivity.</p>
<p>For this reason, before setting out the rules, guidelines, and software development team goals, make sure you did your best to eliminate or alleviate the possible struggles that may occur.</p>
<h2><b>10 Tips To Keep Your Developers Team Effective During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h2>
<p>Luckily, we have already examined the best cases of smart and efficient remote developers management and prepared a quick guide for you to follow. We have taken into consideration the main challenges that can be difficult to tackle and offering comprehensive solutions to the problem. Take a look and enjoy the tips that truly work.</p>
<h3><b>1. Secure a Well-Functioned Tech Facilities and Tools</b></h3>
<p>Firstly, you need some software that will unite all the working processes. To ensure productivity, you’d better have a look at <strong>various collaboration tools perfect for a software development team working remotely.</strong>  Such tools as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/ru/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jira</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/?&amp;aceid=&amp;adposition=&amp;adgroup=77960797405&amp;campaign=1495118561&amp;creative=389415003358&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=trello&amp;matchtype=e&amp;network=g&amp;placement=&amp;ds_kids=p48956357108&amp;ds_e=GOOGLE&amp;ds_eid=700000001557344&amp;ds_e1=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Iv0BRDaARIsAGTWD1u6J2htFRXh6wNFyzNse_aL_oTmPCvKEjPuVZYAT10fuV645yZsumIaAieOEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trello</a>, <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom</a> enable us to stay focused on daily tasks, plan and manage projects. Slack helps our team to stay connected all the time. It’s the place where we <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/remote-team-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainstorm</a> and solve current issues. And Zoom, as a perfect alternative to Skype, is a way more convenient tool to have video calls and screen sharing.</p>
<p>What is more, there are tons of <a href="https://brainhub.eu/blog/tools-for-remote-development-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity tools</a> that are both efficient and have friendly interfaces like Todoist, iDoneThis, and Atlassian Stash. With the help of such systems, it is much easier to have an overall picture needed when working remotely.</p>
<h3><b>2. Make Sure Your Staff Have Everything for Effective Work</b></h3>
<p>But for the obvious essentials like a well-function computer or a laptop and great Internet connection, one should think through all the possible hurdles on the way to a smooth remote working process. Ensure that you have <strong>a backup to the cloud in case there is any accidental deletion of valuable files. </strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, your workers need to have “<a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/secure-collaboration-remote-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">access</a> to servers, development environments, and shared code.” Otherwise, your software developers teams will just stumble upon inconveniences that could lower their productivity.</p>
<h3><b>3. Think Through Communication Channels</b></h3>
<p>Even though many people hate these real face-to-face meetings, during such gatherings, you can communicate fast, transmit your ideas fast, and, most importantly, solve the existing problems fast. When working with remote developers, it is vital to have <strong>regular video meetings.</strong> Not only will regular conferences reduce the problem with the lack of information, but they also help to unite workers and show they are all in this together.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19388 size-full" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-scaled.jpg" alt="Think Through Communication Channels During Coronavirus Crisis" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<h3><b>4. Help Your Workers With Self-Organization</b></h3>
<p>If you want your developers’ team to be productive, you need to show them the importance of <strong>self-organization and discipline</strong>. Teach them to stay online during the working day. What is more, be a great example and don’t bother them with work issues at weekends and when the working day has ended.</p>
<p>Explain that the remote work schedule is no different from work in the office, and this is actually the good news. The reason is simple: you work the same amount of time, but you don’t waste your time commuting, for instance. What is more, psychologically it is less stressful when you do your job within the agreed time period, having no put offs, and then just relax after the work is done.</p>
<h3><b>5. Set Software Development Team Roles and Responsibilities</b></h3>
<p>Make sure both formal and informal roles are distributed effectively so that each employee knows exactly what their responsibilities are. When working remotely, a team <strong>“can truly benefit from having informal roles like various kinds of leaders, idea generators, critics, and doers”</strong>, as it is the key to self-management.</p>
<p>Plus, it is worth mentioning that to maximize productivity, you’d better build small teams of <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/how-manage-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-8 people</a>. Such teams are more autonomous, take responsibility for their initiatives, and as a result, are more efficient. In case you’re developing a big project, you can always divide one team into sub-teams.</p>
<h3><b>6. Keep Everyone Updated</b></h3>
<p>When working together on one project, it is crucial that <strong>all the members are in the loop</strong>, especially in the case of remote developers. For this reason, once again, think through regular conference meetings to discuss the relevant issues. Knowing the status of other projects, or being aware of any changes in the company’s goals and objectives is all crucial to an employee working remotely. That is why ensure that nobody is missing out on anything.</p>
<h3><b>7. Encourage Open Conversation </b></h3>
<p>Let us face reality, COVID-19 is not the usual flu, and it has been a long time since the last serious pandemic. That is why all the people are feeling stressed, anxious, and some can even get depressed. An employer or HR manager encourages open conversation with your workers. Make sure you ask your workers how they feel.</p>
<p><strong>“It is <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/7-tips-for-working-fsuccessfully-managing-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">believed</a> that the main struggle remote workers face is the feeling of loneliness and isolation”.</strong> For this reason, it would be a great idea to offer an opportunity for an online session with the psychologist. After all, you are working with people, and their emotional and physical being is the main priority.</p>
<h3><b>8. Remind About Data Protection</b></h3>
<p>Ensure that your employees are informed about protecting data. Remind them that it isn’t advisable to transfer work data, materials, and emails to their personal devices without permission. In case they do not have any other choice but to work on their personal laptop or computer, make sure that they <strong>take all the necessary precautions</strong> like antivirus software or not letting the browsers save some work passwords, for instance.</p>
<p>What is more, you should ensure <a href="https://intersog.com/blog/software-teams/how-to-keep-your-remote-software-development-team-safe-and-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secure connections</a> with VPN, as well as adopt smart and secure cloud storage solutions.</p>

<h3><b>9. Trust Your Developers Team</b></h3>
<p>If you want to create a comfortable and efficient working environment, it is not about tracking and monitoring productivity all the time or comparing the performance. <strong>It is about believing in your team</strong>, talking to them, and taking an interest in what bothers them. After all, it does not matter whether you work from home or stay in the office. If a team achieves the required outcome, it means they are doing a great job.</p>
<h3><b>10. Goals Are the Priority, Not Activity</b></h3>
<p>According to Forbes contributor Donal Hatter, who specializes in sales and effective leadership, <strong>it is crucial to focus on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/05/30/top-15-tips-to-effectively-manage-remote-employees/#62a35f47503c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">objectives</a> when working with a remote team.</strong> He believes that productivity boils down to the results having been achieved, rather than what is being done. For this reason, the last tip is to focus on the goals you want to achieve with your team and work towards them no matter the obstacles.</p>
<h1><b>How to Motivate and Manage Remote Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis </b></h1>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><em>The COVID-19 pandemic sudden outbreak has affected every industry, business, and organization. But the magnitude of the crisis has disturbed the healthcare industry the most. First and foremost, because this is a human tragedy, affecting their health and lives. It is also pushing front line healthcare workers to battle the virus not known before, draining all the possibilities and resources of this industry.</em></p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol>
<li>Considering the current situation with the global health crisis, digital technologies will drastically reshape the care delivery systems in the short and long term.</li>
<li>Although nowadays, the digital transformation in the healthcare industry is on a rather slow path in comparison with tech, financial, manufacture, and other industries. But still, we have a chance to take advantage of some of the innovations.</li>
<li>Digital healthcare solutions enable new trends in the industry. We might see the rise of the trends like mobile healthcare, IoT healthcare, VR healthcare, robotics, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 is moving quickly, and some changes we see even today. Many health systems are turning to virtual care capacities in order to somehow hold the spread of a deadly virus and survive. From now on, digital technologies will drastically reshape the care delivery systems in the short and long term.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the healthcare industry, like any other one, is influenced by digital transformation. It means that different technological tools and solutions are used to enhance the patient experience, service delivery, create new business models, and make communication more efficient. It’s not only about technology but how and for what purpose it can be implemented to help the healthcare field grow and elevate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19367" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming-.png" alt="Digital Transformation in Healthcare The Changes are Coming" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming-.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming--300x118.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming--600x236.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming--450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Digital transformation in healthcare is going to be an exciting step for society as it automation of the processes, better management, diagnosis, and treatment. Although, the process is slower than compared to digital transformation in banking, for instance. There is a chance to learn more from experience in other industries and even accelerate the process in healthcare based on the available results.</p>
<p>The core aim behind digital transformation is to create more customer-centered services, and it will be of great importance in healthcare as the treatment of every patient can become more personalized, thus making it better for the patients.</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Transformation In Healthcare Industry: New Era For The Society </strong></h2>
<p>Healthcare digital transformation could be a great breakthrough for the medical industry. The implementation of the right solutions will bring a lot of advantages, and some diseases could be cured more effectively and much quicker.</p>
<p>Some companies have already started to use technologies for the benefit of the healthcare industry. Here are some of the examples.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Digital Transformation In Healthcare?</strong></h2>
<p>Digital transformation in healthcare is not only about technologies but, to be more precise, it’s rather about the way to use available tools, software, technologies, etc. to get the most from it for the sake of people’s health. Like any other sphere that is influenced by digital transformation, the healthcare industry puts patients at the center. It means that all the efforts will be put into the enhancement of treatment quality, better analysis, and medicine selection to cure a particular disease.</p>
<p>The transformation has a lot of benefits for all the parties involved, as technologies allow us to work more effectively. Now medical centers and huge healthcare enterprises have to rethink their business strategies and build the way to more opportunities that come with transformation. So, what are the top benefits of digitalization in the healthcare field?</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Transformation Examples In Healthcare</strong></h2>
<p>Although nowadays, the digital transformation in the healthcare industry is on a rather slow path in comparison with tech, financial, manufacture, and other industries. But still, we have a chance to take advantage of some of the innovations. For instance, heart rate trackers that are installed on wearables (fitness trackers, smartwatches) provide important data and can prevent heart attacks, provide health recommendations to the users as they are synced with smartphone apps. One of the examples is the Apple smartwatch that sends alerts once someone experiences atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19368" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry-.png" alt="Digital Healthcare Solutions that Enhance Industry" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry-.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry--300x118.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry--600x236.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry--450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Another bright example of the use of digital technologies in medicine is a company BostonGene. The company uses biomedical software to analyze patients’ disease history to help doctors prescribe the right treatment according to the patient&#8217;s genetics to fight cancer more effectively.</p>
<p>Devices and solutions like this are going to make a great impact on the healthcare field in every country, providing more efficient treatment, better process organization, and reducing costs.</p>
<h2><strong>Top Benefits Of Digital Transformation In Healthcare</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Better Services for Patients<br />
</strong>Healthcare, like any other industry that steps on the path to digital transformation, is patient(customer)-centred. The implementation of numerous technologies will give a chance to make treatment more personalized (as we can see from the examples mentioned above). The individual approach is always better than following common recommendations that might not work in some cases.</li>
<li><strong>Better Analysis<br />
</strong>The use of such technologies as AI or ML gives opportunities to analyze data effectively and much quicker than people can do. Also, these technologies minimize mistakes, thus improving staff productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Better Organization<br />
</strong>Thanks to Cloud computing and other digital tools, all the data could be digitalized. It allows quick access to medical records that give doctors a chance to make decisions effectively and provide more profound treatment. In addition to this, wearable devices could alert both patients and doctors in case of emergency in call the ambulance automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Better Time Management<br />
</strong>The implementation of different digital solutions into the healthcare field saves a lot of valuable time. This is how numerous lives could be saved when we have, for instance, a 24/7 connection with medical staff.</li>
<li><strong>Better Environment for Doctors<br />
</strong>The technologies enable access to a large amount of data; they provide better communication and could provide important information for the research. More profound research that doctors could make results in better treatment and leads us to the first benefit in our list, better services for the patients.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>VR Healthcare</strong><br />
Virtual Reality appointments with a doctor are useful when a patient cannot get to the facility. Also, the use of VR consultations could save a lot of time as patients could immediately contact doctors and describe their symptoms, and by the time they get to the hospital, the doctor would come up with the treatment or prepare everything that is required to take care of the patient effectively and quickly. Apart from this, VR could be used for training medical staff and enhance their skills.</li>
<li><strong>Robotics</strong><br />
The use of robots in healthcare can bring a lot of advantages. For instance, they could assist physicians in examining patients, ship medical supplies, assist with rehabilitation, provide help with medical supplies packing. Also, it could be used for the automation of some processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the most common and popular trends nowadays, but we might see new ones as technologies are constantly changing. So, what are the technologies that enable all these trends and solutions in the modern world?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The novel 2020 pandemic takes every sphere of human activity into the next level. Financial institutions are forced to move quickly to protect their employees, transform their operations, and serve customers in new, improved ways.</p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol>
<li>The software revolution — which has already disrupted many industries and has made some industries essentially obsolete — is still rapidly transforming the financial services industry.</li>
<li>Digital transformation banking strategy should include relevant technologies that can bring the most value for both the bank and its customers.</li>
<li>The future of digital banking transformation is impressive, and it is predicted to entirely change the image of traditional banks, as well as bring more services to the customers.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19371" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png" alt="The Future Of Digital Transformation in Banking" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-300x118.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-600x236.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, more and more organizations will miss their financial targets because of strategic and operational disruptions and dampened customer demand. It’s also unclear how long COVID-19 will last. But one sure thing is here — this will not be a short-term event with fewer consequences. Industries, such as banking, should prepare for the long haul.</p>
<p>However, the software revolution — which has already disrupted many industries and has made some industries essentially obsolete — is still rapidly transforming the financial services industry. Digital transformation in banking has already started, and now we can see some changes like 24/7 online banking and instant transactions.</p>
<p>Still, the process in this sphere is quite slow. To begin a journey to digital transformation, institutions have to develop a detailed strategy to change their distribution model, revise and enhance value offers, as well as develop end-to-end customer-centered processes that can result in growth and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>There are a number of technologies available nowadays that can help in the process of the digital transformation of the banking field. Good digital transformation banking strategy should include relevant technologies that can bring the most value for both the bank and its customers. Among the trending technology solutions, we can distinguish:</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>AI in banking is represented by chatbots or online assistants that help customers with their issues by providing necessary information or executing different transactions. Apart from this, AI can be used for the purpose of data analysis and security. For instance, identify money laundering by analyzing customer data within several seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchain</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of blockchain in banking can result in a better interface, more accuracy, and secured data and transactions. In addition, blockchain solutions will make transactions and different operations transparent, facilitating collaboration. There will be no need for the intermediation of the third parties, thus bringing up the level of trust from the customers. It can also influence cloud technologies and move to decentralized ones, which will result in higher protection of the data and funds.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Of Things</strong></p>
<p>IoT is helpful with real-time data analysis, thus makes the customer experience more personal, and banks are able to provide individually-tailored offers. What is more, thanks to wearables, customers can easily and seamlessly make contactless payments. Apart from this, IoT is helpful with risk management and access to platforms; the authentication process can be supported by biometric sensors that make access more secure and protected.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></p>
<p>Cloud computing is another technology that can help banks become more efficient and gives them a chance to provide more innovations, as well as have better productivity, improve operations, and instantaneously deliver products and services. Cloud computing, as well as IoT, can help with risk management and create a secure environment for the customers and internal bank systems.</p>
<p>All in all, the digital transformation of the banking field will bring great innovations that will change the image of banks we know nowadays. Technologies bring numerous opportunities both for banks and their customers by securing personal data, increasing transparency, and giving a chance to manage funds anytime and anywhere.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation In Investment Banking</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19372" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking.png" alt="Digital Transformation in Investment Banking" width="660" height="310" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-300x141.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-600x282.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-450x211.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Despite all the benefits brought by digital transformation in banking, investment banking is going to face some challenges in the current environment. Investment banking doesn’t take deposits and functions as a facilitator between buyers and sellers and keeps data protected.</p>
<p>As we have already discussed, the rise of digital solutions in banking can result in increased data transparency, elimination of intermediates in the process, and alternative methods to access financial and intellectual data. All this can result in lower pricing on the operations and make transactions easier and faster. Investment banks can be replaced by a group of small investors brought together at one digital platform. The occurrence of new players in the niche (for instance, fintech companies), eliminating entry barriers, and disintermediation can put investment banks in dire straits.</p>
<p>Still, it’s not all doomed, as there always will be a need for professional advice on complex operations and big deals. In order to survive in this competing world, the investment banks should think of the ways to use available data and skills in the digitalized world.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation In Retail Banking</h2>
<p>Retail banks have more opportunities in comparison with investment banks, but still, the journey to digital transformation is rather long and requires a lot of resources. First of all, in order to succeed, their strategy should be customer-centered. Banks possess a lot of important data that can be used as a background for new innovative solutions and services that can satisfy customers to the full.</p>
<p>Technologies like blockchain and AI (Artificial Intelligence) can be of great advantage if the bank wants to survive competition with fintech companies, online banks, and non-financial platforms that provide exact services to their customers and have more advantages over traditional banks. These tools can automate numerous manual operations, thus enhance customer satisfaction. Also, AI and IoT can be used together to collect and analyze personal data of the customers for the banks to create more personalized offers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19373" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking.png" alt="Digital Transformation in Retail Banking" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-300x118.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-600x236.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for retail banks in this situation can be to find a professional team or create an inner IT department. But thanks to the available platforms and outsource companies, this issue can be easily overcome.</p>
<h2>Advantages And Disadvantages Of Digital Transformation In Banking</h2>
<p>Digital transformation of the banking institutions brings a lot of new opportunities for the customers, individual ones, small companies, and huge corporations, as well as banks themselves. Clever strategy and constant improvements can result in a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convenience<br />
</strong>Personal and company bank accounts are available at any device, the only things you need are an Internet connection and a few taps on the screen. This brings more customer satisfaction as they are able to constantly keep on track of their account balance and manage the information on their personal profile (add new mailing address, e-mails, telephone numbers, etc.). In addition to this, there is no need to go to the bank to get checks as they can be instantly sent to your email address.</li>
<li><strong>24/7 Service<br />
</strong>Online banking services are available 24/7 all year round, even at the weekends. There is no need to stay in lines and wait for the bank to open in order to conduct certain operations. It’s a huge advantage that comes with digital solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Time-Saving<br />
</strong>Another advantage, you save a lot of time as you have access to the account from home. It is extremely convenient as previously you could waste an hour or two at the bank to make simple operations, and now it is done seamlessly from home or any other place where there is an Internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Transfers<br />
</strong>Direct banks can provide unlimited automated transfers (accept payroll deposits or provide automatic bill payment) with no additional fees for the services even to outside financial institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Management<br />
</strong>Online accounts can be easily managed, although they require more information than traditional banks. Customers can add information themselves or directly contact online assistants to provide support on the current issue. What is more, payee information is retained within the system, there is no need to re-enter data for the following payments, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19374" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png" alt="Advantages and Disadvantages of Digital Transformation in Banking" width="660" height="340" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png 660w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-300x155.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-600x309.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-450x232.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Although the advantages are impressive, and they facilitate the work to a great extent, there are still some disadvantages that follow the process. Here are the main ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Issues<br />
</strong>Cybersecurity is one of the most important issues that companies and institutions are struggling to overcome. Even sophisticated software that protects tentative data cannot completely protect accounts from scammers, phishing, hacker attacks, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Services<br />
</strong>Nowadays, not all banks can offer a wide range of online services. Still, there are some that require your presence at the traditional banks.</li>
<li><strong>Transactions<br />
</strong>Complex transactions may also require the presence at the bank office. Also, international transactions are not possible with all digital banks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of disadvantages is rather low, and it’s only a matter of time for them to disappear. Advantages take over disadvantages and make daily operations much easier, reduce costs, save customer’s time, and manage to provide services efficiently.</p>
<h2>Challenges Of Digital Transformation In Banking</h2>
<p>The future of digital banking transformation is impressive, and it is predicted to entirely change the image of traditional banks, as well as bring more services to the customers. But today banks face certain challenges that are difficult to overcome:</p>
<h3>Competition With Non-Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>Amazon is trying to provide banking opportunities to its customers. Facebook allows users to make transfers directly to other people’s bank accounts, thus leaving banks out of the process. But banks are more regulated institutions, thus more secure. It is important for them to go digital quicker.</p>
<h3>Online Payments</h3>
<p>Not every bank can support online/mobile or contactless payments. The reason for this is that a bank cannot provide another option but physical payment as it doesn’t have a secure online platform, resources, and skilled team to make it possible. It gets even harder to compete with available online services like ApplePay and PayPal.</p>
<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p>The system that provides online banking services should be constantly updated and have an efficient security level. Cybersecurity is one of the most important issues nowadays that banks should take into consideration first of all. Again, in order to overcome this challenge, the bank has to set up a detailed strategy, choose appropriate technologies and find a professional team that can easily turn ideas into reality with the latest software and available tools.</p>
<p>The process of digital transformation is rather endless as technologies enhance, the systems should be constantly updated. New technologies will give a chance for new services to appear that again will require constant upgrade and support.</p>
<p>Digital transformation in banking is going to speed up in the upcoming years. Financial institutions should take into account the current state of affairs, work out a profound strategy, and use the right tools in order to succeed in the future.</p>
<p>The transformation journey is not an easy thing and involves a lot of resources, but as a result, the services could be more secured and delivered quicker, and most of all, enhance the level of customer satisfaction. As technologies develop and enhance, the banking industry will also get better and better year by year.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">We are executing against one the hardest times of our lives. Businesses are rapidly assessing fast-changing developments and the implications for their organizations. With crises like COVID-19, the time to act is now. The creation of elastic workplaces, efficient BCPs, and distributed workforces might be an answer to uncertain times and can help employees serve customers better while ensuring business continuity.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19199" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-scaled.jpg" alt="distributed teams during pandemic" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-near-window-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>Main points:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Uncertain times: chaos or inevitable opportunism.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">How to act now: an elastic digital workplace and business flexibility.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed agile teams: a new way to deliver at scale.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking one step ahead.</li>
</ol>
<h2>1.  Uncertain times: chaos or inevitable opportunism</h2>
<p>Businesses worldwide have been reacting to the recent humanitarian and societal crisis that is forever going down in history as COVID-19. Today, we already witness an incredible power of the pandemic: disrupted workforces, supply chains, worldwide economic activity, and more to come in months. But what is it really: chaos or new opportunities for organizations to become more flexible and improve their business continuity management plans?</p>
<p>The reality is that every crisis or disaster sooner or later has both immediate and long-term implications of how businesses operate and impact society. So, it is with a sense of urgency that organizations should refer to their decades-long <b>IT business continuity plans</b><b> to ensure their operational and strategic resilience and agility.</b></p>
<p>Leaders (and not only them) are making rapid, highly-informed decisions. They should take immediate action to protect and support their workforce and ensure that all business operations continue in order to help business and societal continuities. Here are some of the most crucial components of how to behave today to safeguard the antifragility of your organization.</p>
<h2>2. IT Business <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;it business continuity plan&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:3700253},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">Continuity Plan</span>: Elastic Workplace and Business Flexibility</h2>
<p>The transition to remote work during coronavirus and distributed teams is accelerating daily. Tools are getting better. More companies embrace the benefits of their employees not being bound to a specific remote workplace on the scale of cities, countries, and even continents. Current disruptions to the workforce (as a result of remote working) requires workplace elasticity and business processes flexibility.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19200" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-scaled.jpg" alt="remote work from home" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/man-laptop-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<h3><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;it business continuity and disaster recovery&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:3700253},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">IT business continuity and disaster recovery</span></h3>
<p>To minimize business disruption and protect employees from consequences of threats, organizations should have not only a profound pandemic plan for business continuity but also be able to emerge from one of the most surreal moments of the recent memory.</p>
<p>Here are the <b>three most essential foundations leaders should pay attention to</b> today:</p>
<p>1. Empowering workforce and building a digital workplace</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>A</b><b>nalyze your current technology capabilities</b>, including a communications plan and support structure. It’s essential to keep leadership and employees aware of current fundamental changes;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Examine your ability to scale out internally.</b> Make sure that digital workplaces enable your people to work remotely through digital collaboration tools;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Start cultivating a digital culture and shifting to the mindset of collaboration.</b> Undoubtedly, your employees will require additional skills around the new way of working. Building the necessary skill set and remote workplace of trust can help employees serve customers better while ensuring business continuity.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Serving your customers’ core needs</p>
<p>Businesses adapt to serve customers through uncertainty. This, of course, means organizations are increasingly thinking out of the box to find creative ways to continue working with clients smoothly.</p>
<p>Highly extendable workplace environments allow organizations <b>to adapt to changing business needs based on global conditions.</b> Moreover, being extremely transparent in communication, operations, and engagements — is key to a successful transition from unpredictability to trusted relationships.</p>
<p>3. Establishing business continuity planning steps</p>
<p>While no systems can perfectly anticipate every contingency, ensuring that all business units are supported, informed, and protected as much as possible, can greatly untie your hands to develop new business processes. This means continuing to work while adapting to the new IT business continuity plan, ways of collaborating, and decision-making. But what is more important — to conduct additional disaster testing scenarios in parallel with operational work.</p>
<h3>Six steps for businesses’ quick reaction</h3>
<p>Today enterprises recognize the need to respond effectively to disruptions caused by factors outside their control. By following these steps for quick workplace adaptation and reaction to risks, companies can highly minimize the disruptions and inefficiencies in their operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Workplace adaptation to disruptions in 2020</b></p>

<h2>3. Distributed Agile Teams: a New Way to Deliver at Scale</h2>
<p>At Intellectsoft, we have worked with distributed teams for many years now. Lowering costs while increasing the pace of business — is no easy task. But it seems to be quite effective and allows for even greater potential benefits if implemented correctly.</p>
<p>Distributed agile teams require more communication and touchpoints. On the other hand, they can bring productivity and speed traditional teams simply cannot. Moreover, communication tools, project management approaches, and planning processes are improving all the time, leaving more space for collaboration and consistency.</p>
<p>Despite being thousands of kilometers apart, every employee interacts with the same board, is able to track the overall progress, and share lessons learned. During turbulent times like today’s one, it is just one of a few reliable ways your company can continually improve the work in a long-term perspective and improve business continuity strategy for the years to come.</p>

<h2>4. Thinking One Step Ahead</h2>
<p>The threats like COVID-19 will fundamentally change the way we work and engage. Leaders should develop a comprehensive BCP and new scenarios for its implementations, paying great attention to those basic steps we describe in this article.</p>
<p>The most important thing to recognize about coronavirus business impact is that operations cannot be considered to be business as usual (BAU) but must become business as survival (BAS).</p>
<p>To achieve the necessary resilience, leadership and С-level should clearly identify what businesses and operational processes in the organization are crucial to operating the core functions, and what — are not.</p>
<p>As the situation keeps developing, we will update our materials, so please check back regularly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Serverless architecture is a step beyond in the technological revolution. Since 2015 (or some say 2012), it has changed the nature of computing. And there is no way back. The real question is, should you consider switching to serverless too?</p>

</ol>
<h1>What is serverless?</h1>
<p>As it is with any new innovation, there is no versatile definition that works for everybody. In the case of serverless, it’s even more real because the concept has developed in a relatively short time. And still, lots of people confuse it with other concepts. Here’s the broad, yet the simple definition of “serverless” we think fits it the best:</p>
<blockquote><p>Serverless is a paradigm of executing applications in cloud-native environments that influences the way applications are built and deployed and makes use of cloud-computing advantages.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simon Wardley, a “serverless” advocate, <a href="https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1073379461473730560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defines</a> it as:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[Serverless is] an event-driven, utility-based, stateless, code execution environment in which you write code and consume services.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>A couple of words on What Serverless is NOT:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>It’s not a container. </b>“A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. Available for both Linux and Windows based apps, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the environment. Containers isolate software from its surroundings, for example, differences between development and staging environments and help reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure,” — shares <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker.com;</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>It’s not a PaaS.</b> Unlike serverless, PaaS refers to a system where there is more (compared to serverless) control over deployment environment; applications take a while to spin up; applications need to be configured to scale automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18782" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676.jpeg" alt="girl works with panoramic view" width="2247" height="1500" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676.jpeg 2247w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-1024x684.jpeg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-2048x1367.jpeg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-600x401.jpeg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-1181676-1000x668.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2247px) 100vw, 2247px" /></p>
<p>In many sources, you can also find that serverless architecture also means <b>“managed services that scale to zero.”</b> That’s why the scale-to-zero approach or pay for the consumption of computing resources (instead of allocation) is a key concept of the serverless. Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2>Scaling to zero as the main concept</h2>
<p>&#8220;Scale to zero&#8221; stops consuming resources when there are no requests. Therefore, computation resources become consumed when in use. Serverless cloud providers automatically scale out the application to handle the increased load.</p>
<p>It reduces the overall costs because <b>customers are only billed for the time that the application is running.</b> It’s also known as pay-per-use (pay for consumption and not for allocation). That’s why scale-to-zero is appropriately seen as the main concept of serverless computing.</p>
<h2>Functions as code</h2>
<p>Serverless is frequently used in conjunction with a <b>function-as-a-service (FaaS)</b> offering. In this case, the code is written as a function. In turn, the function acts as a small single-purpose piece of code that runs dynamically in response to some event trigger or on schedule.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that FaaS allows developers to run backend code without managing their server systems, here are some more essential aspects of it:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to language and environment, FaaS functions are regular applications, but have a range of architectural restrictions;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Using FaaS with serverless computing requires a different approach to deployment as compared to when you manage your servers. Developers upload code in a FaaS environment to the FaaS vendor who then takes over everything related to deployment. Developers don’t have to do anything;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A FaaS vendor covers all the scaling needs. Developers write a function to assume horizontal-scaled parallelism, and the FaaS vendor covers everything scaling-related from that point. Horizontal scaling is fully automated and elastic;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The FaaS provider fully manages resource provisioning and allocation.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get started with FaaS, developers simply bring their function code and wire up event triggers. This is where an event-driven architecture steps in.</p>
<h2>Events as triggers</h2>
<p>The <b>event-driven architecture (or simply EDA)</b> is a software architecture paradigm where code runs in response to events. An event means any change of state in the system, for example, a new message in a queue, the changed record in a DB, a file upload, etc.</p>
<p>Simply put, EDA promotes production, consumption, and reaction to any events. In turn, events trigger business functions or code. For example, when a consumer books a hotel room, the room&#8217;s state changes from &#8220;free&#8221; to &#8220;booked&#8221;. A hotel booking system architecture may treat this state change as an event whose occurrence can be made known to other applications within the architecture.</p>
<h2>Services are all managed</h2>
<p>In a serverless architecture, developers don’t worry about supporting any related services. Such services can include databases, storage, message queues, stream processing, caches, etc.</p>
<p>In turn, developers can connect <b>managed services</b> together, so they shouldn’t think about provisioning, maintaining, and administering these servers and systems. Also, there is no need to ensure application fault tolerance and availability. Cloud providers handle these aspects for them.</p>
<h1>What are the benefits of serverless?</h1>
<p>Before considering the serverless approach for your business, let’s take a closer look at the advantages it has.</p>
<h3><b>1 — Lower Operational Costs</b></h3>
<p>With a Serverless architecture, you pay the vendor only for resources your application consumed, meaning you do not need to allocate costs for managing your own servers, databases, and application logic.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18784" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1.jpg" alt="girls work hard to get tasks done" width="2250" height="1500" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1.jpg 2250w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-1-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" /></p>
<p>While you get the same cost reduction benefits from PaaS (platform as a service) and IaaS (infrastructure as a service), the two do not allow you to pay only for the resources you consume, making Serverless a cheaper option.</p>
<h4>Automated &amp; More Cost-Efficient Scaling</h4>
<p>Serverless comes with automatic and elastic horizontal scaling that is fully managed by the vendor. In many cases, this allows you to cut budget costs in a big way.</p>
<h4>More Optimization — Fewer Expenses</h4>
<p>With a Serverless architecture, there is a direct link between code optimization and operational costs. The more you optimize your application’s code, the less you pay.</p>
<p>Say, your app needs a second to process an event; if you reduce the time to 500 ms, you may instantly save 50% percent from what you paid for minute-long processing. The amount you save may change from vendor to vendor, but the overall picture remains the same — you can save a lot).</p>
<h3><b>2 — Simplified Operational Management</b></h3>
<p>Before starting with this section, it is essential to go back to the fact that Serverless has not matured yet, and different operational nuances will arise as you start using it. Still, that does not dismiss the significant benefits of Serverless architecture in operational management. Let’s see what they are.</p>
<h4>Next-to-no System Administration</h4>
<p>In short, an utterly serverless solution needs zero system administration. The process of packaging and deploying a FaaS function is simple compared to deploying a server — you only need to package your code into a zip file and upload it to the vendor. That’s it. More so, if you are only starting with your application, you can skip the packaging stage and write the code right to the provider’s console.</p>
<h4>More Agility</h4>
<p>The nature of Serverless allows your team to decrease time to market in a reasonable fashion. Plus, with a faster deployment time, teams can experiment with new features and see if the work quickly at a very low cost and with little friction. This, in turn, lowers the lead time and may result in a better final product.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18785" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2.jpg" alt="man looking on his roadmap" width="2250" height="1500" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2.jpg 2250w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/startup-photos-2-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" /></p>
<h3><b>3 — </b><b>Faster time to market</b></h3>
<p>Speed is a new big. Every one aims to get their applications to market as soon as possible. With serverless, it’s quicker and easier: no need to worry about wiring up custom components, the code is shipped many times faster, and there’s less to build from scratch. As a result, developers run deployments with less fuss.</p>
<h3><b>4 — Less Impact on Environment</b></h3>
<p>The world has seen a big spike in the number of data centers in the last ten years, which increased the amount of burnt fossil fuel significantly. Tech giants are considering building centers near renewable energy sources. Still, this will not be enough to reduce the impact due to another issue: highly inefficient capacity management.</p>
<p>According to Forbes, standard servers in organizations deliver <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/06/03/30-of-servers-are-sitting-comatose-according-to-research/#491cd25d59c7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no more than 5 to 15 percent</a> of their maximum computing output on average in a year. Serverless computing, on the other hand, frees companies from the challenging task of provisioning computing, capacity all the while allowing serverless vendors to allow just the right amount of resources for their clients, and only when they need them. So, serverless may be the one and the only solution to optimize data center resources worldwide, lowering their environmental impact dramatically.</p>
<h1>What to keep in mind if you&#8217;re considering serverless?</h1>
<p>Serverless has not matured yet, and this way of building and deploying applications has its advantages just as it has some drawbacks. There is an array of issues you need to know about before switching to this paradigm. We will take a closer look at the inherent flaws of the concept, the ones that will never be fixed entirely.</p>
<h3><b>Lack of Control</b></h3>
<p>Using Serverless means your vendor is in control of the parts of your system. This may lead to a wide variety of issues, including <b>functionality loss, forced API upgrades, system downtime</b>, and other issues that may affect your application and its users.</p>
<h3><b>Security </b></h3>
<p>Every newly emerged concept always has a list of security issues, and that’s also the case with serverless. From insecure serverless deployment configuration to inadequate monitoring and logging of functions and insecure third-party dependencies, these are some of the security issues to pay attention to before jumping in a serverless world.</p>
<h3><b>BaaS-Only Serverless Architecture Issues</b></h3>
<p>Serverless may decrease your operational resources, but not entirely. In the case of a 100% BaaS-based architecture,<b> all the logic will be in the client.</b> Backend-as-a-Service (or BaaS) is a cloud service model in which developers outsource all the behind-the-scenes aspects of a web or mobile application so that they only have to write and maintain the frontend.</p>
<p>So, for your next platforms, you will need to repeat the implementation of a subset of that logic. If you need to migrate to a new database, this will require code replication or coordination change for all of your clients. Another issue with a full BaaS architecture is that you cannot optimize your server design for client performance in no way.</p>
<p>On the bright side, if your serverless architecture uses only FaaS, these issues are non-existent.</p>
<h3><b>Technology Limitations</b></h3>
<p>Not all technologies can be used due to the scale-to-zero concept. The so-called slow <b>“cold start”</b> (first execution after scaling to zero) can lead to performance issues. Some applications require more time to start and then work fast. And for serverless fast startup time is always crucial.</p>
<h3><b>Doesn’t Suite Some Tasks</b></h3>
<p>There are some tasks where serverless is <b>worse fit than traditional models.</b> For such tasks, the usage of serverless may lead to increasing costs.</p>
<h3><b>FaaS-Only Serverless Architecture Issues</b></h3>
<p>FaaS functions have major <b>local state restrictions</b>, meaning you should not take it as given that the state from one invocation of a FaaS function will be available to another invocation of the same function.</p>
<p>If you cannot store states in memory, using a fast NoSQL database may do the trick alongside a number of other options, but all of them are significantly slower than in-memory or on-machine persistence, and the latter will not fit each and every project.</p>
<h1>The Future is Serverless</h1>
<p>It’s hard to predict where serverless computing will be a year from now. Looking back at the current state of serverless, its evolution over the last several years, how vendors address existing issues, as well as the growing community, we can expect the following developments in years to come.</p>
<p><b>Better Tooling</b>. There’s no road ahead for serverless if the existing tooling stops evolving. Luckily, Amazon and other vendors have been improving things like deployment/application bundling and configuration, and we can expect vendors in general to make improvements in other important areas, such as remote debugging and distributed monitoring.</p>
<p><b>Serverless FaaS Will Fit More Applications</b>. Serverless FaaS doesn’t have a consistent in-server state, so such an architecture will not be able to support high-throughput applications.</p>
<p>While vendors will surely try to make function instances active between events for a longer time, the hybrid approach — an architecture combining serverless and non-serverless execution models — is likely to be the better option for such applications.</p>
<p><b>Fewer implementation Issues. </b>From deployment to packaging to integration testing to the opaqueness of monitoring support, there is a very long list of issues when it comes to implementing serverless applications as of today. As vendors are gradually fixing implementation-related issues, we can expect them to deal with all the problems existing in this area today as well.</p>
<p><b>Emergence of First Solid Serverless Practices</b>. Although a lot is clear about nature serverless computing and how it can benefit teams and applications they design, it is still a very, very young field will little-to-no guidelines for the long-term as well as many blank spaces across the board.</p>
<p>So, in the next several years, we can expect the serverless rule book to start shaping up. It will outline where serverless fits best and where traditional ways are more favorable, the best ways to implement serverless, how to build a hybrid serverless architecture, and so on. The answers will come from both sides — the vendors, and the community.</p>
<p>That doesn’t end here, but vendors will surely try to tackle these first. Will serverless become the new normal for application architectures? It has the potential, but, as with many things, only time will tell.</p>
<h1>Should your business switch to serverless now?</h1>
<p>In 2017 the serverless market was worth around $3 billion. By 2025, it’s predicted to go up to $20 billion. Many giants are already adopting serverless. To name a few, Netflix, Coca Cola, Airbnb, EA, Vevo, MongoDB, Accenture, etc.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18787" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics.jpg" alt="graph for serverless stats in the usa" width="1170" height="740" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics.jpg 1170w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-1024x648.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-768x486.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-600x379.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-450x285.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/analytics-1000x632.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" />If you consider switching to serverless, we suggest keeping in mind two things:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You should not migrate all your apps to serverless right away. Try and test first;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Serverless is the right direction for the future for two main reasons: it gives the opportunity to deliver value to customers quickly and lets you pay only for the used resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, there are still numerous pitfalls and execution bottlenecks utilizing serverless. Moreover, security is one of the top issues that should be resolved over time. Yet one thing the entire market knows is that serverless is inevitable, and it will own the market. It’s all just a matter of time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several decades ago people could easily imagine their life without technologies, but modern generations would not understand how is it possible to live a comfortable life without mobile phones, laptops, the Internet, etc. We all can see the speed at which technologies are changing, developing and upgrading. All of them are making our daily life easier, more comfortable and give us a lot of great opportunities.</p>
<p>The wave of new technologies also changes the way enterprises operate. In order to survive in this world of constant competitions, enterprises and organizations should be able to quickly adopt the new comings and successfully use them to promote their business, get more customers and accelerate the revenue.</p>
<p>Talking about the latest tendencies in business, if you want to keep up with the rest of the world and do not lose your positions in the field you should consider going automated. Digital transformation of the firm is possible thanks to all the great technologies that are available nowadays, including cloud computing, IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR), etc. But a secret to success lies not only in a good implementation. It greatly depends on the digital transformation strategy. What is it? What are the components that should be included? Let’s dive deeper into this subject.</p>
<h2>What Is Digital Transformation Strategy?</h2>
<p>Before we will define the term “digital transformation strategy”, first of all, let’s find out what is a strategy itself.</p>
<p>A strategy is a thoroughly considered and detailed plan of long-term goals accomplishment. When talking about business, a strategy is a general influence and ultimate position that you want to achieve. How is it possible? First of all, you should remember that every approach consists of minor short-term tactics that are directed to achieve small (or let’s even say “primary”) goals.</p>
<p>In order to make a plan work, you have to include in it your whole team, every department and employee. Everyone should know their responsibilities and be motivated to reach every goal, step by step. And that’s how you can put up these small objectives into a bigger picture resulting in a total transformation of your business.</p>
<p>An approach should have clear tactics directed to achieve certain goals. Envolved staff have to understand these goals and know their position within the roadmap to change.</p>
<p>Digital transformation strategy, based on the information above, is a set of rules, principles and objectives that will help the firm or organization successfully implement automated technologies and use them effectively to keep the enterprise on the run. It involves cultural, IT, business, and marketing aspects. Each of them should be taken into consideration by diving into thorough research to come up with ideas, tactics, objectives, as well as foresee the future.</p>
<p>Development of the aligned transformation tactics will not only incorporate digital technologies into the system of your organization, but it also has some other advantages that come hand in hand. What is more, having a detailed plan will keep you away from some mistakes and help you overcome hurdles that might pop up on your way. First, we will take a look at some bright examples of transformation strategies we can analyze today and then, come up with conclusions.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Strategy Examples</h2>
<p>Before you start mulling over and developing a blueprint for your own firm, check the strategies of other companies. It’s not that important to analyze your competitors, as to understand the principles, key elements, and learn how to organize work within the enterprise, as well as set short-term and long-term goals. Also, it’s important to understand that the process cannot be done within several months, we are talking about years, as transformation should be incorporated step by step. It follows that digital transformation strategy is a years-long plan that requires profound research, constant testing and renovation. Some enterprises have already started that process, don’t fall behind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Car Connect by PorscheFor instance, a popular car manufacturer, Porsche, has created an application that serves as a co-pilot for the driver. It connects you and your car via a smartphone. The system is integrated into the car and has several great features that turn every journey into a pleasant experience. First of all, real-time data and traffic reports will suggest the fastest way to your destination point. It also offers voice control, has an in-build Apple Music, and helps you find all the information you need about destination points, as well as shows gas stations on your way. What is more, you can control the vehicle just from the smartphone (lock or unlock a car, control air conditioning, etc).Porsche company has gone even further by creating unique IDs for every customer in order to collect data of user experience. It is important for the project to provide innovations, but it is also important to analyze it and have feedback from the clients.</li>
<li>IKEA and Augmented Reality AppIKEA is another example of a digital transformation. They’ve come up with an idea to create an app that helps customers to choose the most suitable furniture for their homes. It saves a lot of time and offers the best options for the place to match the interior of the apartment. Customers can beside which furniture to buy beforehand and there is no need to spend hours at the shop.</li>
<li>Disney: From TV to the InternetDisney started to lose their positions several years ago and the firm needed to provide serious changes and come up with a new approach. That’s why they’ve bought streaming services and created an online platform, like Netflix. The decision to go automated was worth to try, as the firm has managed to reach more clients, thus generating higher revenue.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What Does Digital Transformation Strategy Means for Business?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The examples above demonstrate that a good digital transformation strategy can be of great value for the business. Overall, we can highlight several advantages that come hand in hand with a transformation.</p>
<ul>
<li>A better user experience that results in new clients: thanks to the various<br />
technologies that are available nowadays, corporations are able to provide high-quality service to their clients. The better you get with clients and delivery of services, the more new clients will use the facilities you offer.</li>
<li>More qualified employees: as technologies keep developing and becoming better,<br />
the company should empower the staff of the organization with relevant knowledge. As digital transformation is a rather new concept and education we get usually doesn’t provide us with all the necessary skills, it is important to get on-hands experience, as well as go through business training.</li>
<li>High in-company organization: implementation of new systems or technologies helps<br />
businesses to have more efficient work organization within the organization.</li>
<li>Brings higher revenue: all the advantages listed above result in higher revenue for<br />
the company that leads to even better services, renovation of technologies, and higher salaries for the employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, it is important to say that success lies in an innovative idea that can be fulfilled in life by using the latest technologies (IoT, AI, AR, etc.), fast and efficient service, and highly-qualified staff. By incorporating all the elements into one big organism, going digital becomes real, thus bring numerous advantages for the business.</p>
<h2>Five Elements of Digital Transformation Strategy that Lead to Success</h2>
<p>So far we have discussed the meaning behind digital transformation strategy, viewed several examples and figured out its importance for the business. But what are the core elements of it? Based on the information we have, we can highlight five essential keys to a successful transformation scenario.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Analyze the situation and come up with the idea: without the idea, there is no need to start the fuss. It’s important to know your position among the competitors and understand current state of the firm. The idea that promotes digital transformation should be innovative and bring value for all the parties involved: customers, employees, corporation and its partners. Know the story you want to tell your board in order to win their attention and motivate them.</li>
<li>Unite all the players and set up goals: first of all, before you start the process of digital transformation and set up a scheme, involve every department and staff into a big game. Share your vision and align every element into one organization. It means that managers of all the departments have to work as a coherent unit, where everyone knows their position and responsibilities to minimize mistakes on your way. Also, take into consideration the ideas your employees provide and set up short-term and long-term goals.<br />
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18710" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Five-Elements-of-Digital-Transformation-Strategy-that-Lead-to-Success-.jpg" alt="Five Elements of Digital Transformation Strategy that Lead to Success" width="452" height="301" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Five-Elements-of-Digital-Transformation-Strategy-that-Lead-to-Success-.jpg 452w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Five-Elements-of-Digital-Transformation-Strategy-that-Lead-to-Success--300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Five-Elements-of-Digital-Transformation-Strategy-that-Lead-to-Success--450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></li>
<li>Choose relevant technology: businesses are offered a number of technologies that can be used in the process of digital transformation. Learn about them and choose the most suitable one for your company. The technology should suit your business needs and be able to lead you to the goals the firm wishes to reach in the upcoming future. Communicate with different vendors, learn about the services they offer and make sure you are on the same page before choosing the one for cooperation.</li>
<li>Document risks and run pilot tests: the organization should be prepared for all outcome scenarios in the process of digital transformation and implementation of new technologies. It cannot be done overnight as the process is quite tedious and time-consuming. Before you start, document all the risks you might face. Running pilot tests will help you calculate the risks and be prepared. For instance, first, you can start with one department in your company, see how it works, how technology helps your business, analyze occurring pitfalls. Once you know all the details and made some changes, run a test again and try to incorporate into the process another department. Thus, step by step you move to the full digital transformation of the business.</li>
<li>Be ready for a change: once you put your feet on the path of digital transformation and start using new technologies, keep analyzing the process. It means to be ready for any cultural change that comes up your way. Pay attention to every element, take into consideration customer’s feedback as well as from your staff. Data analysis can help you find new directions for the business, enhance services, and be ready to provide new changes into the work of your company.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, we can say that the future of different business areas lies in digital transformation. It will affect spheres like health care, finance, commerce, education, retail, even government systems and security. If you have great ideas of how to use available technologies, you should start making strategies to fulfill them right now.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to business, small companies and huge enterprises should quickly react to the latest changes in their field, technologies, marketing strategies, etc. They should be able to adapt to current trends and successfully implement them into the workflow of their system.</p>
<p>The faster and wisely you respond to the changes, the more chances you get to succeed in the future. Marketing and business overall are not static, and it is essential to keep up with trends, use them for your company, thus gaining more customers and revenue. Nowadays, businesses go through digital transformation. What is it? How can it benefit your business?</p>
<p>Let’s dive into the details of this topic.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Definition Explained</h2>
<p>Digital transformation is an integration of digital technology solutions into the work of the company. Although the term is mainly used about business, it is also applied to government, mass media, culture, medicine, science segments of society. It changes the way the company works and elevates the customer experience. Digital transformation is also used as a synonym to “paperless,” meaning that all the data is digitalized and stored in the company’s system.</p>
<p>The implementation of these solutions into your business will affect every department and all the operations that are carried within the company. It will change the way your company functions internally and externally. Thus, going through digital transformation successfully will bring value to the overall business workflow and customer experience.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Examples: You’ve Already Seen Them</h2>
<p>If you think that you haven’t seen any digital transformation examples, you are wrong. The change might be slow, but it happens. For instance, have you shopped on Nike’s website? You can check it if you didn’t. The first thing that impresses most is that you can create your own design of the shoes online. Thus, the user experience becomes more personalized, and the company can offer the best options available to suit the customer&#8217;s taste. What is more, there is no vendor involved in the process, and customers buy the products directly from Nike.</p>
<p>Another bright example of digital transformation is Disney. A few years ago, they were falling behind, but the company has come up with the idea of buying streaming services and turning Disney into the online platform, where you can watch movies. As a result, they are back on track and managed to increase their revenue.</p>
<p>One more example is Microsoft who has shifted from traditional software to cloud-based and managed to survive the competition with Apple and Amazon.</p>
<p>The examples of digital transformation can be found everywhere nowadays affecting every area of human activity.</p>
<h2>What’s the Difference Between Digital Transformation and Business Transformation?</h2>
<p>When it comes to business and digital transformations, the first one is a broader term that incorporates other transformations. It means that when a company wants to keep up with the latest tendencies that are appearing daily and wishes to deliver better services, have a better workflow, and better communication with customers, it has to go through a business transformation.</p>
<p>So, a business transformation involves all the changes in every department of the company and consists of:<br />
&#8211; digital transformation (mainly is directed to facilitate and enhance the customer area of the company or inner company organization);<br />
&#8211; IT functional transformation (focuses on how the work is done within the IT department of the company);<br />
&#8211; enterprise transformation (directed on how the work is done within the company).</p>
<p>To put it in other words, a business transformation requires to set new business models that much depend on modern market demands. While digital transformation is about how this model can work and what tools and solutions are necessary to make new strategies work in the best way possible, meaning facilitating business-customer area of work, business-business cooperation, as well as inner company system organization of work (business-employee). Digital transformation is focused on technological tools and solutions that can deal with operational problems to reach the goal of business transformation.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Framework: The Guidelines</h2>
<p>To successfully implement and use new technologies, you have to come up with the guidelines. In other words, you need a blueprint, which is a digital transformation framework, with a detailed description of the process, parties, and components involved. It is a supporting structure around which you can build-in new technologies, and you can flawlessly move from one thing to another according to it along the way to digitalization.</p>
<p>Digital transformation framework involves four components:<br />
&#8211; Processes and systems;<br />
&#8211; Organization;<br />
&#8211; Product;<br />
&#8211; Customer.</p>
<p>It is important to note that no specific framework will work for all the existing businesses, but there are essential components that should be taken into consideration. Thus, the CEO of the companies can analyze the data they have and create an individualized framework for their business. For instance, customers are an essential part of every business. Learn more about your customers. See what they like or dislike by going through the information they search for. This information is vital for modern businesses as they can use this data in digital marketing and personalize services, and as a result, enhance the customer experience.</p>
<p>Apart from better customer experience, the information you get from them can be used to enhance the products and make them suit customers individually. The same goes for services and processes. You can provide personalized service by taking into account the data you have about the clients and lead them through the whole purchase process.</p>
<p>Apart from this, think about how you can empower the inner company organization. You can improve logistics and employee experience by using digital technologies (like cloud, IoT, AI, etc.). By choosing automation and standardization, businesses can stay agile and quickly respond and adjust to the latest changes, as well as maintain and increase the profit.</p>
<p>To create a successful framework of digital transformation define all the important aspects of your company that stand behind these four components.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Roadmap</h2>
<p>The moment you set a framework of digital transformation, you can start building a roadmap of the process. To make it easier, remember that there are three main stages that should be outlined and divided into smaller steps in the roadmap. Here they are:</p>
<p>Stage 1: Defining value. This stage involves securing senior management. It’s the first step. You have to make sure that everyone in the company is involved in the process and takes an active part in it. Gather board meetings with management, as well as different departments of the company, to define the goals of the transformation. Make them challenging and motivating. The last but not least step on this stage is the budget. Allocate funds on the resources and technologies to be used.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Launching and maintaining a digital transformation. First, think of the lighthouse projects you can launch at the beginning of the transformation process. Once they are tested and operate at their best, you can follow up with the related projects to continue the transformation. Next, gather high-profile professionals in your team who will have all the necessary skills. Moving further, think of the new agile ways of the work organization.</p>
<p>Stage 3: Scaling up. From now on you have to continually upgrade and innovate the technologies you use as they develop and continuously offer new features and capabilities. Apart from technology, your employees should also be appropriately trained and be able to acquire new skills. And the last thing that should be included in the roadmap is the adoption of the new operating model. From now on, the focus will be shifted to new centers, so the model should suit them.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Technology: What Can Be Used?</h2>
<p>Digital transformation for businesses of different industries is necessary due to all the emerging technologies. These technologies change the way companies function and organize their work. They help to deliver better user experience, as well as bring more revenue for the business.</p>
<p>Today we have several technologies that can be implemented into the company’s system. Each technology can be tailored to the needs of your business and level up the services you provide. There are certain tendencies in the technology used for the digital transformation of the enterprise, this list includes:</p>
<p>&#8211; Cloud Computing<br />
Cloud computing can be the first thing to consider when embarking on the path of digital transformation. There are several good reasons for this. Think about how you can improve internal and external processes, operations, and services. Cloud computing has the required infrastructure, platforms, and computing abilities, thus helps you stay agile in your business field and ready to embrace the latest changes in the world of technology. Taking this into account, Cloud computing is cost and labor effective, secure (you can omit system shutdowns and create several backups). Scale and speed come with Cloud computing, two essential things the company needs to move towards digital transformation nowadays.</p>
<p>&#8211; Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)<br />
AI and ML, when properly used for digital transformation, can help businesses gain additional income and reduce time spent on executing day-today activities. ML is capable of analyzing big and complex data and making accurate decisions based on the available information. Thanks to the implementation of these technologies there is less room for errors and more for impeccable high-quality service.</p>
<p>&#8211; Blockchain<br />
Blockchain is a powerful asset for the companies that are heading to digital transformation. The use of this technology will facilitate transactions, eliminating the third party in the process, thus making it easier and more transparent both for partner businesses and clients. The point is to make decentralized ledger that will reduce transaction time and cost, as well as will be more secure.</p>
<p>&#8211; Augmented Reality (AR)<br />
Augmented Reality is a technology that can change and boost operational activities of the departments and enhance the competitiveness of the company on the market. AR gives a chance to see inside of the objects (for instance, machines, bodies, etc.) without opening them and have a full description of the problem found inside. It can be applied for product development, maintenance, and safety measures.</p>
<p>&#8211; Internet of Things (IoT)<br />
Another way to make a digital transformation is to use the Internet of Things (IoT). Like the previous ones, this technology brings a lot of benefits to the business. For instance, it opens several new opportunities for the company thanks to the collected data that can be used to understand your customers and their needs better and, as a result, offering them better services. Also, IoT can help you expand the circle of your target audience. In addition, it improves employee productivity and reduces costs, as the processes are automized.</p>
<p>Think of the technologies listed above and how they can be useful for your company.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation Process: How Is It Done?</h2>
<p>Digital transformation cannot be completed in one day. It’s rather a continuous process that involves a lot of work. Any process involves several stages, so you should think about the <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/what-is-digital-transformation-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategy</a> for your company, the execution part of the process, and its outcome. Setting a plan is ⅓ of the process, but going digital without one is a lost cause. Here are the steps you should follow to outline the process of digital transformation:</p>
<p>Step 1. Analyze the current state of affairs within the company and outside. It is important to understand where you stand at this very moment, know your strong and weak sides. Check how the competitors are dealing with the similar problems you face.</p>
<p>Step 2. Set up transformation objectives. What do you want to see as the final result? What is the goal of the company? Which operations, departments, or processes should be renovated? These are the essential questions you have to answer before moving to the next stages of the process. Involve your employees into the process as much as possible, as they do certain activities daily and know all the pitfalls or inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Step 3. Choose the right technology and outline the budget. When thinking of the technology to be implemented into the work of the company, provide thorough research. The technology should suit the needs of your company, employees, and clients. Communicate with the vendor and set close relationships for further collaboration, as support of the system is as important as its development or implementation. Make sure the technology is scalable, so you can continue to grow if some part needs to be innovated or changed.</p>
<p>Step 4. Create a clear roadmap for the process and prioritize the activities. Access the capabilities of the company, resources, budget, identify changes, and do a cost-benefit analysis. Then, logically prioritize activities.</p>
<p>Step 5. Identify and train your team. Choose employees and create teams that can execute the implementation of technology. All the changes that are going to be made should be demonstrated to the employees. It is important to educate your staff, so can do digitally transformed business, once the system starts to operate differently.</p>
<p>Step 6. Implement the changes. Do everything that is required to incorporate the technology into the work of your company, run tests, and add additional changes if needed.</p>
<p>Step 7. Provide ongoing support of the new technologies and use new features to scale up the performance of the system and services.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Digital Transformation: How Is It Useful for Your Business?</h2>
<p>Taking into account the information stated above, we can highlight several benefits that come with digital transformation. Although the process can be time-consuming and require a lot of resources to be completed, still the advantages it offers, cover the expenses.</p>
<p>So, what are the benefits we get with the digital transformation of business?</p>
<p>1. Less manual work as operations and processes will be automized, thus making the overall work more efficient and almost flawless.<br />
2. Reduced time spent on day-to-day activities, as the system will be automized.<br />
3. The client’s satisfaction will grow. It follows from the benefits listed above. Flawless and quick service will win the hearts of your clients and more likely make them your regular customers.<br />
4. Increased revenue. This advantage is also a result of the listed above. Reduced time and errors in the process save up a lot of funds, and loyal clients will bring more revenue.</p>
<p>These are four significant benefits a digital transformation brings to businesses, both small and large ones. Of course, the list is not complete, as everyone will find something different for their own business.</p>
<h2>Future of Digital Transformation: What Is Next?</h2>
<p>Digital transformation is a rather new concept for now, and it only starts to develop and penetrate different business fields and spheres of human activity. We already know the benefits it possesses and can only imagine how it will look like in the future, as the technologies constantly upgrade, evolve, and acquire new features.</p>
<p>The tendency mainly prevails in IT and financial spheres, but it has a lot of potential and can be used to improve government matters, health, and insurance, retail, education, etc. Companies should take a serious look at digital transformation and make use of it for their systems to survive current and future competitions, keep their clients and increase revenue.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to practical software development questions, it’s hard to find the right answers in Google immediately. Usually, the most useful tips are hidden in the bits of information from Quora, forums, or unreadable articles.</p>
<p>Actually, distinguishing between Redis and MongoDB is exactly the same case. But the problem is solved here. Read this overview to fill the informational vacuum on this topic!</p>
<h2>Redis vs MongoDB: Introduction to the topic</h2>
<p>For those who never heard these two words before, Redis and MongoDB are two NoSQL databases. Logically, being the two types under the same class, they have both structural similarities and differences. But what exactly they are?</p>
<p>In terms of similarities, Redis and MongoDB are common in these areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The release year: 2009</li>
<li>The license type: Open Source</li>
<li>Compatibility with several operating systems: Windows, Linux, and OS X</li>
<li>Supporting several programming languages: C, C#, C++, Clojure, D, Dart, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Java, Javascript, Lisp, Lua, MatLab, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Python, R, Ruby, Scala, and Smalltalk</li>
<li>Secondary indexes: Enabled status</li>
<li>Replication: Master-slave</li>
<li>Compatible with: ScaleGrid, CData</li>
<li>Need the same amount of time to build sophisticated requests for data processing</li>
</ul>
<p>But of course, they are also different – in their original model, basically.</p>
<p>Redis works within memory and serves as a compositional element of a software system. There, you can find it as a database, cache, or message broker. This simplest management system works with pairs of keys and values, making the process similar to working with a dictionary.</p>
<p>In its turn, MongoDB is a document store. This format makes it autonomous enough to work as a cloud technology or a part of self-service infrastructure. It is not fixed by the single scheme requirement but uses internal notations.</p>
<h2>So, what’s the basis of the dissimilarity between two databases?</h2>
<p>Because of the different original model basis, there were times when Redis and MongoDB were simply incomparable. But recently, s search engine became a secondary database model for both Redis and MongoDB. And this modification (titled Percona Memory Engine) made it possible to compare Redis vs MongoDB as equals.</p>
<p>Simply put, Redis is generally known by high performance, while MongoDB is more efficient in terms of API used. But of course, there are more details and practical applications to know for sure how to choose a database. Let’s check how they differ in terms of speed, performance, configuration, and other processing criteria.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18297" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Redis-Framework-300x100.png" alt="Redis Framework Advantages" width="300" height="100" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Redis-Framework-300x100.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Redis-Framework-768x257.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Redis-Framework-600x200.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Redis-Framework-450x150.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Redis-Framework-1000x334.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Redis-Framework.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2>Advantages of Redis</h2>
<p>One the one hand, Redis framework is the in-memory database useful for cache, message brokering, and the development tasks that require outstanding performance.</p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<ol>
<li>Redis is an excellent choice for caching. With it, you can build sophisticated data structures and get access to multiple options to store and query information.</li>
<li>The installation process is simple, and the database is easy to maintain.</li>
<li>The system is persistent. Even though the database copes with heavy loads of information, the clear key-value structure protects it from hassles.</li>
<li>Redis framework is the top pick for “hot data,” or the information you need to process fast. In this case, it’s able to process up to 1GB at once.</li>
<li>It has an effective message transport system that is easily replicated on various machines within one cluster.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Disadvantages of Redis</h2>
<p>Of course, Redis also has some shortcomings you should be aware of. In fact, all of them are related to the in-memory structure of this database.</p>
<p>Here are these structural elements Redis lacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>It doesn’t maintain encryption on the wire.</li>
<li>Redis sticks to its principle of mandatory storage to all the data.</li>
<li>There is no basis to divide roles and responsibilities within the database (frequently referred to as “role-based account control”).</li>
<li>Since the information is stored is separate structural units that are connected in pairs, it’s hard to provide the deliberate clustering.</li>
<li>It’s hard to connect Redis to massive cloud databases in big organizations. Also, if you want to scale it, you have no choice but to create several interlinked Redis databases.</li>
<li>You can’t simply input data into Redis. This database requires your architectural skills to determine the saving and structuring of your information in advance.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18298" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-MongoDB-Framework-300x81.png" alt="Advantages of MongoDB Framework" width="300" height="81" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-MongoDB-Framework-300x81.png 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-MongoDB-Framework-1024x276.png 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-MongoDB-Framework-768x207.png 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-MongoDB-Framework-600x162.png 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-MongoDB-Framework-450x121.png 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-MongoDB-Framework-1000x270.png 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-of-MongoDB-Framework.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Advantages of MongoDB</h2>
<p>On another hand, MongoDB framework is frequently stored on the disk, being referred to as Persona memory storage engine. To function, it creates JSON interface for information. Also, to empower the performance of MongoDB, search engines are frequently connected to this database.</p>
<p>That’s the reason why MongoDB database has collected many advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>MongoDB effectively solves the issue of cost and speed for choosing an appropriate solution. Precisely, it offers several assumptions you can choose from.</li>
<li>It’s simple to understand and use, thanks to the user-friendly JSON format of representation.</li>
<li>MongoDB is the best choice for scaling because you can distribute it on various platforms.</li>
<li>All the basic functionality is in-built – including SSL, RBAC, and scale-out.</li>
<li>It enables playing with many features – including aggregations and map-reduce.</li>
<li>It saves your resources spent on extra learning and maintenance spending.</li>
<li>It’s a great choice for managing customer analytics and product catalogs. Empowered by a docker container, the database is effective while dealing with information system projects.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Disadvantages of MongoDB</h2>
<p>In fact, MongoDB framework has disadvantages when you try to use it for tasks that are more complicated than simple prototyping. Also, there are some other nuances:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s ineffective for caching. To complete this development task, the very structure of MongoDB database is too chaotic. So, in any case of fast and straightforward processing, this framework has severe drawbacks.</li>
<li>It lacks persistence. MongoDB database doesn’t have a sustainable basis for coping with replicas still.</li>
<li>MongoDB can’t maintain elements for binding sustainably.</li>
<li>While scaling, you may experience problems with moving analytical and rich searching data.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Redis vs MongoDB: Speed</h2>
<p>In the competition of Redis vs MongoDB, the latter is known for its high speed. Because MongoDB is simpler in use and structure, it doesn’t require much and can be fast. On the contrary, the presence of fragmented elements in the internal structure of Redis forces it to take more time for processing.</p>
<h2>Redis vs MongoDB: Performance</h2>
<p>Both databases are compute-bound. However, Redis manages to perform the same quality on one core, while MongoDB uses multiple cores to succeed. In practice, your Redis database can fly as fast as your cache!</p>
<p>Everything has its price, though – and Redis framework pays for its outstanding performance by using much more RAM for storage purposes.</p>
<h2>Redis vs MongoDB: Configuration</h2>
<p>Based on YCSB measurement tests, the comparison of Redis and MongoDB also revealed the better performance of Redis.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: How to choose between Redis and MongoDB?</h2>
<p>And as a final titbit, here are the most useful insights from user experience for you to choose between Redis and MongoDB:</p>
<ol>
<li>Revise the level of your development team before making a choice. For the beginners, the simplicity of MongoDB turns it into the top pick. But if you need the full functionality of a database and can dedicate extra time to learn how to master it, go for Redis.</li>
<li>Determine the deadline for the development task. Usually, Redis takes more time to create the internal structure of queries and customize their types. On the contrary, MongoDB uses one structure and enables finishing the development task faster.</li>
<li>Measure the complexity of the development task. MongoDB is a classic database that is better for simple work and prototyping. Also, it’s useful for Junior software developers or the teams that work in startups or during Hackathons. In its turn, Redis is more innovative, complex, and flexible. It needs more time to master – but in return, you gain a deeper knowledge and the wider horizon of development opportunities in return.</li>
<li>Check how much you know about the project. If you don’t know everything, go for MongoDB. This database uses prescribed schema (through the app), so you don’t need to input everything manually. But if you choose Redis, be ready to explicitly define how you want to store information to use this database comfortably.</li>
</ol>
<p>In sum, many developers go for MongoDB, thanks to its speed, effectiveness, and elegance. After the introduction of Percona Memory Engine (which improved the performance characteristics of this database), their number even increased. At the same time, the novelty and flexibility of Redis makes a preferable choice for pro developers.</p>
<p>At the same time, you should always keep in mind that Redis and MongoDB are different as a bicycle and a car. In reality, the speed you want, the number of resources available, and the distance you need to complete are the real factors for selecting between these frameworks.</p>
<p>In the end, both Redis and MongoDB are good at coping with the task of data storage and maintenance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the classification of various IT professions, distinguishing software developer and software engineer positions causes one of the greatest confusions. Since many people perceive software development as a sort of engineering activity and envision engineering as an art of developing human achievements, it’s hard to see the clear difference between these professions as well.</p>
<p>But actually, the difference between software developers and software engineers exists.</p>
<p>Many observers try to find interesting metaphors to represent this idea and provide the distinction between two titles. They mostly refer to the analogy of a musher and a sled, or an architect and a carpenter. They work well on clarifying the extent of responsibility, but this is still an oversimplified representation of their difference. The truth is that both specialties share an important similarity in working together on the same goal. So, these two analogies should contain a crucial supplement that both do the same job and work on the same product but choose the different paths to achieve it. Precisely, a software developer starts by looking in-depth and then goes wider, while a software engineer chooses a broader perspective and steadily learns to distinguish tiny details. To put it even simpler, both specialists do the same thing – the difference is only in scale, either limited or large.</p>
<p>So, is there really a conflict labeled ‘software developer vs software engineer’? The short answer is, “Yes, but to a certain extent.” Continue reading to see why!</p>

<h2>What is software engineer?</h2>
<p>So, the software engineer. The mastermind behind the entire process within a software development life cycle. The systematic thinker who needs an entire team of co-thinkers to supply IT specialists with the necessary instruments.</p>
<p>The word “engineer” completely reflects the essence of the job that is done in this position – such specialist projects complex tools to facilitate the activity for both a customer and an artist.</p>
<p>Software engineer deals with big issues. On a daily basis, this person practices in solving them from a visionary standpoint. That’s the reason why he/she needs to keep track of how the entire process works – not only on the development stage but also on the design, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of the computer system. Besides, this professional needs to know how to control the components of the hardware. It’s crucial to keep all the technical characteristics and compatibility requirements.</p>
<p>In short, a software engineer is a hard-working team player who knows how and why to create helpful instruments for the software system to function. All these skills enable the application of the most effective approaches and practices for constructing tools. Because of that, this specialist resembles susuwatari, soot gremlins from anime ‘Spirited Away’ who helped Kamaji (or a software developer) in working. Or ants, if to use a more realistic metaphor.</p>

<h2>What is a software developer?</h2>
<p>The main task of a software developer is to write business-effective programs. And to do it well, he/she works as a free talent who creatively uses software tools and crafts needed applications for various platforms from them. Because of that, the specialist should be effective for the entire project and meet its goals step-by-step to help the software development process go on smoothly and productively.</p>
<p>In fact, the software developer is working with the same issues as a software engineer – he/she simply concentrates on the development stage within the software development life cycle and uses a more creative approach to solving its issues. For this position, it’s more important to come up with a workable solution than spend time on thinking whether this program fits all the process requirements and takes into account all the factors around the project. The bigger task is to make from the mess of tools a program that works.</p>
<p>Each and every day, software developer writes code and creates solutions that can work on one or several platforms, depending on how many of them the client has mentioned in the order. Since this position is tied to the development stage only, many observers tend to differ it from a software engineer’s one by positing the limited area of its activity. But that’s not accurate: software developer has much more creative power and complex vision while creating programs. Constructing the basis of software, this professional works as an independent artist and makes the readymade tool really work – and remain visionary and solve big issues.</p>

<h2>So what&#8217;s the role of software engineer &amp; software developer in our days?</h2>
<p>So, what’s the main role of a software engineer in the business process? To put it simply, that’s helping both customers and employers get maximum benefit from the solution designed and developed by a software development company. For this specialist, the crucial task is to ensure the integrity and freedom of all the stakeholders involved. In this context, the ability to provide ethical leadership is another key skill needed.</p>
<p>Among the most needed proficiency for a software engineer, this position requires possessing technical competence, emotional leadership, and awareness of all the basic tools (like automated testing and fault-tolerant systems) along with high-tech trends (like cloud technologies and Big Data). All this theoretical and practical background is needed to project the design philosophy that will maintain not only working solutions but also the entire IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>As for the role of a software developer, this person sticks to creating programs and making the entire business work. He uses the prepared tools to creatively develop apps designed and takes into account the client’s needs in them. That’s why the list of responsibilities on this position goes beyond coding and calls for experience in thematic review, design, specification, debugging, documentation, and optimization.</p>
<p>Moreover, the list of needed qualifications for a software developer includes knowing computer languages and possessing soft skills – especially analytical thinking and client-centeredness. By distinguishing the customer’s needs and tastes, this specialist becomes able to design and develop the high-standard and working set of components that perfectly match together.</p>

<h2>So, is there really a difference between a software engineer and a software developer?</h2>
<p>And he we are, back to the question, “What’s the difference between software developer vs software engineer?”. To make the answer short, both specialists work on creating effective software, so the difference is slight. On the one hand, a software engineer is a scientist who initiates new systems and tools. On another hand, a software developer is an artist who creates new programs and software networks.</p>
<p>But during their career paths, these two positions find themselves more similar. That’s because a true software specialist is both a developer and an engineer, knowing exactly how and why to construct software solutions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As this is a quick guide for busy people, let’s get straight to the business: talent isn’t always an answer when searching for a good programmer. And here’s why.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a small startup just looking for an enthusiastic developer ready to share your mad ideas, or you’re a huge company trying to create a dream team of the best professionals, choosing a new employee is always a challenge. For one thing, those who seem to be the best ones are already hired. For another, these days expertise is just the half of success.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18028" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-Find-Programmers-1024x575.jpg" alt="How to Find Programmers" width="1024" height="575" /></p>
<p>If you want to find a developer who will offer exceptional and effective solutions, you need to look for an employee possessing particular qualities and skills. To make it easier for you, we have already singled out the essential traits your perfect candidate should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good communication skillsIt’s not only about coding. Being able to communicate, explain the troubles they may be having, and just finding a common language with other members of a team is one of the key traits a good developer should have. As an entrepreneur, your goal is your company success, and it can only be achieved if your employees are working together. In other words, they talk and they understand each other needs, desires, and troubles.</li>
<li>Able to work under pressureNeedless to say that sometimes the deadlines can become tough. That is why, look for a person who won’t be scared away by the possibility of hard work. Otherwise, you may end up with a developer quitting your project last minute, and thus having no project at all.</li>
<li>OrganizedOnce again referring to deadlines. Writing a code can be tricky, as you can’t always predict what can go wrong. Still, it doesn’t justify long delays of the development process. For this reason, a person working with a code should be organized and great at time-management.</li>
<li>DedicatedFinally, a trait that is as important as any other is dedication. You should know better than anyone that if employee’s eyes sparkle with a twinkle of interest in the project, the whole working process is done easier, faster and more effective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you know the key qualities for your future developer to have, so let’s have a look at some tips of how to find such an employee (and sometimes persuade to work for or with you).</p>
<h2>How to Find Programmers for a Startup: A Partner Maybe?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18029" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-Find-Programmers-for-a-Startup-1024x683.jpg" alt="How to Find Programmers for a Startup" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p>First and foremost thing to keep in mind is that searching for a developer for a company-to-be is way different than for already established organizations. Not only do you have to find a professional, but you should also convince them that the germ of your idea is something really worth time and effort. That is why, we will help you with two steps. Step #1 is where to find a programmer. Step #2 is how to convince a professional to work for you.</p>
<h3>Step #1 &#8211; Where to search</h3>
<ul>
<li>Networking SitesThe easiest place to start are networking sites like LinkedIn. You set up the criteria of an employee you’re looking for and connect with the candidates right up your street.</li>
<li>Attend Industry EventsA truly effective way to search for a developer is going to places packed with industry workers. For this reason, check out the nearest events dealing with startups, app or software development, and connect with people there.</li>
<li>Places to ConnectLook for sites where programmers communicate. For instance, you can choose meetup.com, search for groups with developers and start connecting with people there. (Don’t scare them away with all your ideas at once, move the conversation slowly).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step # 2 &#8211; How to Persuade a Programmer to Work for/with You</h3>
<p>Needless to say that passion is essential when working on any project. However, startup ideas greatly depend on enthusiasm and excitement, so you need to take this into consideration when looking for a programmer.</p>
<p>Firstly, decide whether you are looking for an employee to complete the project, or you are trying to find a partner/co-founder who will breathe life into your idea.</p>
<p>Secondly, make sure that your startup idea already has clear definitions and goals. In other words, validate your ideas before looking for a developer. If your idea already has possible clients, it is more likely that a professional coder will get interested in your project.</p>
<p>Finally, be organized and set your requirements straight. There is nothing worse than a never-ending project with tons of amendments. Such undertakings are often doomed to failure and great programmers will hardly agree to work for projects as such.</p>
<h2>Simple Steps to Find a Developer Who Will Meet Your Demands</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18030" src="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Simple-Steps-to-Find-a-Developer-Who-Will-Meet-Your-Demands-1024x678.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Simple-Steps-to-Find-a-Developer-Who-Will-Meet-Your-Demands-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Simple-Steps-to-Find-a-Developer-Who-Will-Meet-Your-Demands-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Simple-Steps-to-Find-a-Developer-Who-Will-Meet-Your-Demands-768x508.jpg 768w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Simple-Steps-to-Find-a-Developer-Who-Will-Meet-Your-Demands-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Simple-Steps-to-Find-a-Developer-Who-Will-Meet-Your-Demands-600x397.jpg 600w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Simple-Steps-to-Find-a-Developer-Who-Will-Meet-Your-Demands-450x298.jpg 450w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Simple-Steps-to-Find-a-Developer-Who-Will-Meet-Your-Demands-1000x662.jpg 1000w, https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/Simple-Steps-to-Find-a-Developer-Who-Will-Meet-Your-Demands.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have grasped the idea of a perfect candidate for your position, you need to make sure they truly satisfy your requirements. So here’s what you should do.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Get Prepared for the InterviewYou need to prepare for the interview as well as a candidate themselves. Make sure you have noted down the questions that are crucial to be asked. To find a programmer who will offer smart solutions to your problems, you need to ask clear questions. That is why, playing it by ear at the interview wouldn’t be a smart decision.</li>
<li>Let the Candidate Validate their ResumeThe position of a developer requires practical knowledge, and the ability to work in unpredicted environment. For this reason, no matter how good someone’s resume may sound, you’d better check it with some testing. For instance, choose some of the tech tasks you have already solved, and offer it as an exemplary situation. A candidate for the position should offer their solution to the problem, and this is how you can see whether they’re suitable for the position. By the way, if you don’t specialize in programming yourself, ask your professional developers to be present at the interview. This is how you can get an expert opinion.</li>
<li>Focus on Cultural FitEven though writing a code may seem like something done individually, in fact it requires tons of communication among developers themselves and the whole team of workers. For this reason, it is essential for a future employee to fit into your working environment. If you need to find a software developer, for instance, and your team members are located in different parts of the world, communication is the essential part of good work.</li>
<li>Be Specific and OpenThere is nothing worse than employer hiding something from their future employees. That is why be open and straightforward. Make your requirements clear. For one thing, this is how you ensure a person is aware of them, and you are on the same wavelength. For another, any employee likes to know what they are expected to do, so that there will be no unexpected surprises later.</li>
<li>Make Your Offer AlluringIf you have found a truly great professional, make sure your offer is fair and enticing. Today companies are hunting for the top specialists, so don’t lose one for being greedy.</li>
</ol>
